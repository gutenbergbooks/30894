<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> circumstances which have made me responsible for
selecting and editing the correspondence of Robert Louis
Stevenson are the following. He was for many years my
closest friend. We first met in 1873, when he was in his
twenty-third year and I in my twenty-ninth, at the place
and in the manner mentioned at page 54 of this volume.
It was my good fortune then to be of use to him, partly
by such technical hints as even the most brilliant beginner
may take from an older hand, partly by recommending
him to editors&mdash;first, if I remember right, to Mr. Hamerton
and Mr. Richmond Seeley, of the Portfolio, then in succession
to Mr. George Grove (Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine), Mr.
Leslie Stephen (Cornhill), and Dr. Appleton (the Academy);
and somewhat, lastly, by helping to raise him in the
estimation of parents who loved but for the moment
failed to understand him. It belonged to the richness
of his nature to repay in all things much for little,
<span class="grk" title="hekatomboi enneaboiôn">&#7953;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#8054; &#7952;&#957;&#957;&#949;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</span>, and from these early relations
sprang the affection and confidence, to me inestimable,
of which the following correspondence bears evidence.</p>

<p>One day in the autumn of 1888, in the island of Tahiti,
during an illness which he supposed might be his last,
Stevenson put into the hands of his stepson, Mr. Lloyd
Osbourne, a sealed paper with a request that it might be
opened after his death. He recovered, and had strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexviii"></a>xviii</span>
enough to enjoy six years more of active life and work in
the Pacific Islands. When the end came, the paper was
opened and found to contain, among other things, the
expression of his wish that I should prepare for publication
&ldquo;a selection of his letters and a sketch of his life.&rdquo; I had
already, in 1892, when he was anxious&mdash;needlessly, as it
turned out&mdash;as to the provision he might be able to leave
for his family, received from him a suggestion that &ldquo;some
kind of a book&rdquo; might be made out of the monthly journal-letters
which he had been in the habit of writing me from
Samoa: letters begun at first with no thought of publication
and simply in order to maintain our intimacy, so far
as might be, undiminished by separation. This part of
his wishes I was able to carry out promptly, and the result
appeared under the title <i>Vailima Letters</i> in the autumn
following his death (1895). Lack of leisure delayed the
execution of the remaining part. For one thing, the body
of correspondence which came in from various quarters
turned out much larger than had been anticipated. He
did not love writing letters, and will be found somewhere
in the following pages referring to himself as one &ldquo;essentially
and originally incapable of the art epistolary.&rdquo;
That he was a bad correspondent had come to be an
accepted view among his friends; but in truth it was only
during one period of his life that he at all deserved such
a reproach.<a name="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> At other times, as became apparent after
his death, he had shown a degree of industry and spirit
in letter-writing extraordinary considering his health and
his occupations. It was indeed he and not his friends, as
will abundantly appear in the course of these volumes,
who oftenest had cause to complain of answers neglected
or delayed. His letters, it is true, were often the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexix"></a>xix</span>
informal in the world, and he generally neglected to date
them, a habit which is the despair of editors: but after
his own whim and fashion he wrote a vast number, so
that the work of sifting, copying, and arranging was long
and laborious. It was not until the autumn of 1899 that
the <i>Letters to his Family and Friends</i> were ready for
publication, and in the meantime the task of writing the
<i>Life</i> had been taken over by his cousin and my friend, Mr.
Graham Balfour, who completed it two years later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In considering the scale and plan on which my friend&rsquo;s
instruction should be carried out&rdquo; (I quote, with the
change of a word or two, from my Introduction of 1899),
&ldquo;it seemed necessary to take into account, not his own
always modest opinion of himself, but the place which
he seemed likely to take ultimately in the world&rsquo;s regard.
The four or five years following the death of a writer
much applauded in his lifetime are generally the years
when the decline of his reputation begins, if it is going
to suffer decline at all. At present, certainly, Stevenson&rsquo;s
name seems in no danger of going down. On the stream
of daily literary reference and allusion it floats more
actively than ever. In another sense its vitality is confirmed
by the material test of continued sales and of
the market. Since we have lost him other writers, whose
beginnings he watched with sympathetic interest, have
come to fill a greater immediate place in public attention;
but none has exercised Stevenson&rsquo;s peculiar and personal
power to charm, to attach, and to inspirit. By his study
of perfection in form and style&mdash;qualities for which his
countrymen in general have been apt to care little&mdash;he
might seem destined to give pleasure chiefly to the fastidious
and the artistically minded. But as to its matter, the
main appeal of his work is not to any mental tastes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexx"></a>xx</span>
fashions of the few; it is rather to universal, hereditary
instincts, to the primitive sources of imaginative excitement
and entertainment in the race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The voice of the <i>advocatus diaboli</i> has been heard
against him, as it is right and proper that it should be
heard against any man before his reputation can be held
fully established. One such advocate in this country has
thought to dispose of him by the charge of &lsquo;externality.&rsquo;
But the reader who remembers things like the sea-frenzy
of Gordon Darnaway, or the dialogue of Markheim with
his other self in the house of murder, or the re-baptism of
the spirit of Seraphina in the forest dews, or the failure
of Herrick to find in the waters of the island lagoon a last
release from dishonour, or the death of Goguelat, or the
appeal of Kirstie Elliot in the midnight chamber&mdash;such a
reader can only smile at a criticism like this and put it
by. These and a score of other passages breathe the
essential poetry and significance of things as they reveal
themselves to true masters only: they are instinct at once
with the morality and the romance which lie deep together
at the soul of nature and experience. Not in vain had
Stevenson read the lesson of the Lantern-Bearers, and
hearkened to the music of the pipes of Pan. He was
feeling his way all his life towards a fuller mastery of
his means, preferring always to leave unexpressed what
he felt that he could not express adequately; and in
much of his work was content merely to amuse himself
and others. But even when he is playing most fancifully
with his art and his readers, as in the shudders, tempered
with laughter, of the <i>Suicide Club</i>, or the airy sentimental
comedy of <i>Providence and the Guitar</i>, or the
schoolboy historical inventions of Dickon Crookback and
the old sailor Arblaster, a writer of his quality cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi"></a>xxi</span>
help striking notes from the heart of life and the inwardness
of things deeper than will ever be struck, or even
apprehended, by another who labours, with never a smile
either of his own or of his reader&rsquo;s, upon the most
solemn enterprises of realistic fiction, but is born without
the magician&rsquo;s touch and insight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another advocate on the same side, in the United
States, has made much of the supposed dependence of
this author on his models, and classed him among writers
whose inspiration is imitative and second-hand. But this
is to be quite misled by the well-known passage of Stevenson&rsquo;s
own, in which he speaks of himself as having in his
prentice years played the &lsquo;sedulous ape&rsquo; to many writers
of different styles and periods. In doing this he was not
seeking inspiration, but simply practising the use of the
tools which were to help him to express his own inspirations.
Truly he was always much of a reader: but it
was life, not books, that always in the first degree allured
and taught him.</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&lsquo;He loved of life the myriad sides,</p>
<p class="i05">Pain, prayer, or pleasure, act or sleep,</p>
<p class="i05">As wallowing narwhals love the deep&rsquo;&mdash;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>so with just self-knowledge he wrote of himself; and the
books which he most cared for and lived with were those
of which the writers seemed&mdash;to quote again a phrase of
his own&mdash;to have been &lsquo;eavesdropping at the door of
his heart&rsquo;: those which told of experiences or cravings
after experience, pains, pleasures, or conflicts of the spirit,
which in the eagerness of youthful living and thinking
had already been his own. No man, in fact, was ever less
inclined to take anything at second-hand. The root of
all originality was in him, in the shape of an extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxii"></a>xxii</span>
natural vividness of perception, imagination, and feeling.
An instinctive and inbred unwillingness to accept the
accepted and conform to the conventional was of the
essence of his character, whether in life or art, and was
a source to him both of strength and weakness. He would
not follow a general rule&mdash;least of all if it was a prudential
rule&mdash;of conduct unless he was clear that it was right
according to his private conscience; nor would he join,
in youth, in the ordinary social amusements of his class
when he had once found out that they did not amuse
<i>him</i>; nor wear their clothes if he could not feel at ease
and be himself in them; nor use, whether in speech or
writing, any trite or inanimate form of words that did
not faithfully and livingly express his thought.  A
readier acceptance alike of current usages and current
phrases might have been better for him, but was simply
not in his nature. No reader of this book will close it,
I am sure, without feeling that he has been throughout
in the company of a spirit various indeed and many-mooded,
but profoundly sincere and real. Ways that in
another might easily have been mere signs of affectation
were in him the true expression of a nature ten times
more spontaneously itself and individually alive than that
of others. Self-consciousness, in many characters that
possess it, deflects and falsifies conduct; and so does the
dramatic instinct. Stevenson was self-conscious in a high
degree, but only as a part of his general activity of mind;
only in so far as he could not help being an extremely
intelligent spectator of his own doings and feelings: these
themselves came from springs of character and impulse
much too deep and strong to be diverted. He loved also,
with a child&rsquo;s or actor&rsquo;s gusto, to play a part and make a
drama out of life: but the part was always for the moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiii"></a>xxiii</span>
his very own: he had it not in him to pose for anything
but what he truly was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a man so constituted had once mastered his
craft of letters, he might take up whatever instrument
he pleased with the instinctive and just confidence that
he would play upon it to a tune and with a manner of
his own. This is indeed the true mark and test of his
originality. He has no need to be, or to seem, especially
original in the form and mode of literature which he
attempts. By his choice of these he may at any time
give himself and his reader the pleasure of recalling, like
a familiar air, some strain of literary association; but in
so doing he only adds a secondary charm to his work;
the vision, the temperament, the mode of conceiving and
handling, are in every case personal to himself. He may
try his hand in youth at a <i>Sentimental Journey</i>, but R. L. S.
cannot choose but be at the opposite pole of human
character and feeling from Laurence Sterne. In tales of
mystery, allegorical or other, he may bear in mind the
precedent of Edgar Poe, and yet there is nothing in style
and temper much wider apart than <i>Markheim</i> and <i>Jekyll
and Hyde</i> are from the <i>Murders in the Rue Morgue</i> or
<i>William Wilson</i>. He may set out to tell a pirate story
for boys &lsquo;exactly in the ancient way,&rsquo; and it will come
from him not in the ancient way at all, but re-minted;
marked with a sharpness and saliency in the characters,
a private stamp of buccaneering ferocity combined with
smiling humour, an energy of vision and happy vividness
of presentment, which are shiningly his own. Another
time, he may desert the paths of Kingston and Ballantyne
for those of Sir Walter Scott; but literature presents few
stronger contrasts than between any scene of <i>Waverley</i>
or <i>Redgauntlet</i> and any scene of the <i>Master of Ballantrae</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiv"></a>xxiv</span>
or <i>Catriona</i>, whether in their strength or weakness: and it
is the most loyal lovers of the older master who take the
greatest pleasure in reading the work of the younger, so
much less opulently gifted as is probable&mdash;though we
must remember that Stevenson died at the age when
Scott wrote <i>Waverley</i>&mdash;so infinitely more careful of his
gift. Stevenson may even blow upon the pipe of Burns
and yet his tune will be no echo, but one which utters the
heart and mind of a Scots maker who has his own outlook
on life, his own special and profitable vein of smiling
or satirical contemplation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by reason, then, of &lsquo;externality,&rsquo; for sure, nor
yet of imitativeness, will this writer lose his hold on the
attention and regard of his countrymen. The debate,
before his place in literature is settled, must rather turn
on other points: as whether the genial essayist and egoist
or the romantic inventor and narrator was the stronger
in him&mdash;whether the Montaigne and Pepys elements prevailed
in his literary composition or the Scott and Dumas
elements&mdash;a question indeed which among those who care
for him most has always been at issue. Or again, what
degree of true inspiring and illuminating power belongs to
the gospel, or gospels, airily encouraging or gravely didactic,
which are set forth in the essays with so captivating a
grace? Or whether in romance and tale he had a power
of inventing and constructing a whole fable comparable
to his admitted power of conceiving and presenting single
scenes and situations in a manner which stamps them
indelibly on the reader&rsquo;s mind? And whether his figures
are sustained continuously by the true spontaneous breath
of creation, or are but transitorily animated at happy
moments by flashes of spiritual and dramatic insight, aided
by the conscious devices of his singularly adroit and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxv"></a>xxv</span>
spirited art? These are questions which no criticism but
that of time can solve. To contend, as some do, that
strong creative impulse and so keen an artistic self-consciousness
as Stevenson&rsquo;s was cannot exist together, is
quite idle. The truth, of course, is that the deep-seated
energies of imaginative creation are found sometimes in
combination, and sometimes not in combination, with an
artistic intelligence thus keenly conscious of its own purpose
and watchful of its own working.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once more, it may be questioned whether, among the
many varieties of work which Stevenson has left, all distinguished
by a grace and precision of workmanship which
are the rarest qualities in English art, there are any which
can be pointed to as absolute masterpieces, such as the
future cannot be expected to let die. Let the future decide.
What is certain is that posterity must either be very well
or very ill occupied if it can consent to give up so much
sound entertainment, and better than entertainment, as
this writer afforded his contemporaries. In the meantime,
among judicious readers on both sides of the Atlantic,
Stevenson stands, I think it may safely be said, as a true
master of English prose; scarcely surpassed for the union
of lenity and lucidity with suggestive pregnancy and poetic
animation; for harmony of cadence and the well-knit
structure of sentences; and for the art of imparting to
words the vital quality of things, and making them convey
the precise&mdash;sometimes, let it be granted, the too curiously
precise&mdash;expression of the very shade and colour of
the thought, feeling, or vision in his mind. He stands,
moreover, as the writer who, in the last quarter of the nineteenth
century, has handled with the most of freshness
and inspiriting power the widest range of established
literary forms&mdash;the moral, critical, and personal essay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxvi"></a>xxvi</span>
travels sentimental and other, romances and short tales
both historical and modern, parables and tales of mystery,
boys&rsquo; stories of adventure, memoirs&mdash;nor let lyrical and
meditative verse both English and Scottish, and especially
nursery verse, a new vein for genius to work in, be forgotten.
To some of these forms Stevenson gave quite new life;
through all alike he expressed vividly an extremely personal
way of seeing and being, a sense of nature and
romance, of the aspects of human existence and problems
of human conduct, which was essentially his own. And
in so doing he contrived to make friends and even lovers
of his readers. Those whom he attracts at all (and there
is no writer who attracts every one) are drawn to him
over and over again, finding familiarity not lessen but
increase the charm of his work, and desiring ever closer
intimacy with the spirit and personality which they
divine behind it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the fitting scale, then, on which to treat the
memory of a man who fills five years after his death such
a place as this in the general regard, and who has desired
that a selection from his letters shall be made public, the
word &lsquo;selection&rsquo; has evidently to be given a pretty liberal
interpretation. Readers, it must be supposed, will scarce
be content without the opportunity of a fairly ample
intercourse with such a man as he was accustomed to
reveal himself in writing to his familiars. In choosing from
among the material before me&rdquo; (I still quote from the
Introduction of 1899), &ldquo;I have used the best discretion
that I could. Stevenson&rsquo;s feelings and relations throughout
life were in almost all directions so warm and kindly, that
very little had to be suppressed from fear of giving pain.<a name="FnAnchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxvii"></a>xxvii</span>
On the other hand, he drew people towards him with so
much confidence and affection, and met their openness
with so much of his own, that an editor could not but
feel the frequent risk of inviting readers to trespass too
far on purely private affairs and feelings, including those
of the living. This was a point upon which in his lifetime
he felt strongly. That excellent critic, Mr. Walter Raleigh,
has noticed, as one of the merits of Stevenson&rsquo;s personal
essays and accounts of travel, that few men have written
more or more attractively of themselves without ever
taking the public unduly into familiarity or overstepping
proper bounds of reticence. Public prying into private
lives, the propagation of gossip by the press, and printing
of private letters during the writer&rsquo;s lifetime, were things
he hated. Once, indeed, he very superfluously gave himself
a dangerous cold, by dancing before a bonfire in his
garden at the news of a &lsquo;society&rsquo; editor having been committed
to prison; and the only approach to a difference
he ever had with one of his lifelong friends arose from the
publication, without permission, of one of his letters written
during his first Pacific voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far, then, must I regard his instructions about
publication as authorising me to go after his death beyond
the limits which he had been so careful in observing and
desiring others to observe in life? How much may now
fairly become public of that which had been held sacred
and hitherto private among his friends? To cut out all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxviii"></a>xxviii</span>
that is strictly personal and intimate were to leave his
story untold and half the charm of his character unrevealed:
to put in too much were to break all bonds of
that privacy which he so carefully regarded while he lived.
I know not if I have at all been able to hit the mean, and
to succeed in making these letters, as it has been my
object to make them, present, without offence or intrusion,
a just, a living, and proportionate picture of the man as
far as they will yield it. There is one respect in which
his own practice and principle has had to be in some degree
violated, if the work was to be done at all. Except in
the single case of the essay <i>Ordered South</i>, he would never
in writing for the public adopt the invalid point of view,
or invite any attention to his infirmities. &lsquo;To me,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;the medicine bottles on my chimney and the blood
on my handkerchief are accidents; they do not colour
my view of life; and I should think myself a trifler and
in bad taste if I introduced the world to these unimportant
privacies.&rsquo; But from his letters to his family and friends
these matters could not possibly be left out. The tale of
his life, in the years when he was most of a correspondent,
was in truth a tale of daily and nightly battle against
weakness and physical distress and danger. To those
who loved him, the incidents of this battle were communicated,
sometimes gravely, sometimes laughingly. I have
greatly cut down such bulletins, but could not possibly
omit them altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1911, twelve years after the above words were
written, the estimate expressed in them of Stevenson&rsquo;s
qualities as a writer, and of the place he seemed likely to
maintain in the affections of English readers all the world
over, had been amply confirmed by the lapse of time.
The sale of his works kept increasing rather than diminishing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxix"></a>xxix</span>
Editions kept multiplying. A new generation of
readers had found life and letters, nature and human
nature, touched by him at so many points with so vivifying
and illuminating a charm that it had become scarcely
possible to take up any newspaper or magazine and not
find some reference to his work and name. Both series
of letters&mdash;even one mainly concerned, as the <i>Vailima
Letters</i> are, with matters of interest both remote and
transitory&mdash;had been read in edition after edition: and
readers had been and were continually asking for more.
The time was thought to have come for a new and
definitive edition, in which the two series of letters already
published should be thrown into one, and as much new
material added as could be found suitable. The task of
carrying out this scheme fell again upon me. The new
edition constituted in effect a nearly complete epistolary
autobiography. It contained not less than a hundred
and fifty of Stevenson&rsquo;s letters hitherto unpublished.
They dated from all periods of his life, those written in
the brilliant and troubled days of his youth predominating,
and giving a picture, perhaps unique in its kind, of a
character and talent in the making. The present edition
is a reprint of the edition of 1911, with a few errors of
transcription and one or two of date corrected, and with
a very few new letters added.</p>

<p>Much, of course, remains and ought to remain unprinted.
Some of the outpourings of the early time are
too sacred and intimate for publicity. Many of the letters
of his maturer years are dry business letters of no general
interest: many others are mere scraps tossed in jest to
his familiars and full of catchwords and code-words current
in their talk but meaningless to outsiders. Above all,
many have to be omitted because they deal with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxx"></a>xxx</span>
intimate affairs of private persons. Stevenson has been
sometimes called an egoist, as though he had been one in
the practical sense as well as in the sense of taking a lively
interest in his own moods and doings. Nothing can be
more untrue. The letters printed in these volumes are
indeed for the most part about himself: but it was of
himself that his correspondents of all things most cared
to hear. If the letters concerned with the private affairs
of other people could be printed, as of course they cannot,
the balance would come more than even. We should
see him throwing himself with sympathetic ardour and
without thought of self into the cares and interests of
his correspondents, and should learn to recognise him
as having been truly the helper in many a relation
where he might naturally have been taken for the
person helped.</p>

<p>As to the form in which the Letters are now presented,
they fill three volumes instead of the four of the 1911
edition, the division into fourteen sections according to date
being retained. As to the text, it is faithful to the original
except in so far as I have freely used the editorial privilege
of omission when I thought it desirable, and as I have not
felt myself bound to reproduce slips and oddities, however
characteristic, of spelling. In formal matters like
the use of quote-marks, italics, and so forth, I have adopted
a more uniform practice than his, which was very casual
and variable.</p>

<p>To some readers, perhaps&mdash;(from this point I again
resume my Introduction of 1899, but with more correction
and abridgment)&mdash;to some, perhaps, the very lack of art
as a correspondent to which Stevenson, as above quoted,
pleads guilty may give the reading an added charm and
flavour. What he could do as an artist in letters we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxi"></a>xxxi</span>
know. I remember Sir John Millais, a shrewd and very
independent judge of books, calling across to me at a
dinner-table, &ldquo;You know Stevenson, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and
then going on, &ldquo;Well, I wish you would tell him from me,
if he cares to know, that to my mind he is the very first
of living artists. I don&rsquo;t mean writers merely, but painters
and all of us. Nobody living can see with such an eye
as that fellow, and nobody is such a master of his tools.&rdquo;
But in his letters, excepting a few written in youth and
having more or less the character of exercises, and a few
in after years which were intended for the public eye,
Stevenson the deliberate artist is scarcely forthcoming at
all. He does not care a fig for order or logical sequence or
congruity, or for striking a key of expression and keeping
it, but becomes simply the most spontaneous and unstudied
of human beings. He has at his command the
whole vocabularies of the English and Scottish languages,
classical and slang, with good stores of the French, and
tosses and tumbles them about irresponsibly to convey
the impression or affection, the mood or freak of the
moment; pouring himself out in all manner of rhapsodical
confessions and speculations, grave or gay, notes of
observation and criticism, snatches of remembrance and
autobiography, moralisings on matters uppermost for the
hour in his mind, comments on his own work or other
people&rsquo;s, or mere idle fun and foolery.</p>

<p>By this medley of moods and manners, Stevenson&rsquo;s
letters at their best come nearer than anything else to the
full-blooded charm and variety of his conversation. Nearer,
yet not quite near; for it was in company only that his
genial spirit rose to his very best. Few men probably
have had in them such a richness and variety of human
nature; and few can ever have been better gifted than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxii"></a>xxxii</span>
he was to express the play of being that was in him by
means of the apt, expressive word and the animated look
and gesture. <i>Divers et ondoyant</i>, in the words of Montaigne,
beyond other men, he seemed to contain within
himself a whole troop of singularly assorted characters.
Though prose was his chosen medium of expression, he
was by temperament a born poet, to whom the world was
full of enchantment and of latent romance, only waiting
to take shape and substance in the forms of art. It was
his birthright&mdash;</p>

<p>He had not only the poet&rsquo;s mind but the poet&rsquo;s senses:
in youth ginger was only too hot in his mouth, and the
chimes at midnight only too favourite a music. At the
same time he was not less a born preacher and moralist
and son of the Covenanters after his fashion. He had
about him, as has been said, little spirit of social or other
conformity; but an active and searching private conscience
kept him for ever calling in question both the grounds of
his own conduct and the validity of the accepted codes
and compromises of society. He must try to work out
a scheme of morality suitable to his own case and temperament,
which found the prohibitory law of Moses chill and
uninspiring, but in the Sermon on the Mount a strong
incentive to all those impulses of pity and charity to which
his heart was prone. In early days his sense of social
injustice and the inequalities of human opportunity made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxiii"></a>xxxiii</span>
him inwardly much of a rebel, who would have embraced
and acted on theories of socialism or communism, could
he have found any that did not seem to him at variance
with ineradicable instincts of human nature. All his life
the artist and the moralist in him alike were in rebellion
against the bourgeois spirit,&mdash;against timid, negative, and
shuffling substitutes for active and courageous well-doing,&mdash;and
declined to worship at the shrine of what he called
the bestial goddesses Comfort and Respectability. The
moralist in him helped the artist by backing with the
force of a highly sensitive conscience his instinctive love
of perfection in his work. The artist qualified the moralist
by discountenancing any preference for the harsh, the
sour, or the self-mortifying forms of virtue, and encouraging
the love for all tender or heroic, glowing, generous,
and cheerful forms.</p>

<p>Above all things, perhaps, Stevenson was by instinct
an adventurer and practical experimentalist in life. Many
poets are content to dream, and many, perhaps most,
moralists to preach: Stevenson must ever be doing and
undergoing. He was no sentimentalist, to pay himself
with fine feelings whether for mean action or slack inaction.
He had an insatiable zest for all experiences, not the
pleasurable only, but including the more harsh and biting&mdash;those
that bring home to a man the pinch and sting of
existence as it is realised by the disinherited of the world,
and excluding only what he thought the prim, the conventional,
the dead-alive, and the cut-and-dry. On occasion
the experimentalist and man of adventure in him
would enter into special partnership with the moralist and
man of conscience: he was prone to plunge into difficult
social passes and ethical dilemmas, which he might sometimes
more wisely have avoided, for the sake of trying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxiv"></a>xxxiv</span>
behave in them to the utmost according to his own personal
sense of the obligations of honour, duty, and kindness.
In yet another part of his being he cherished, as his great
countryman Scott had done before him, an intense underlying
longing for the life of action, danger and command.
&ldquo;Action, Colvin, action,&rdquo; I remember his crying eagerly
to me with his hand on my arm as we lay basking for his
health&rsquo;s sake in a boat off the scented shores of the Cap
Martin. Another time&mdash;this was on his way to a winter
cure at Davos&mdash;some friend had given him General Hamley&rsquo;s
<i>Operations of War</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;in which,&rdquo; he writes to his father,
&ldquo;I am drowned a thousand fathoms deep, and O that I
had been a soldier is still my cry.&rdquo; Fortunately, with all
these ardent and divers instincts, there were present two
invaluable gifts besides: that of humour, which for all
his stress of being and vivid consciousness of self saved
him from ever seeing himself for long together out of a
just proportion, and kept wholesome laughter always ready
at his lips; and that of a most tender and loyal heart,
which through all his experiments and agitations made
the law of kindness the one ruling law of his life. In the
end, lack of health determined his career, giving the chief
part in his life to the artist and man of imagination, and
keeping the man of action a prisoner in the sickroom until,
by a singular turn of destiny, he was able to wring a real
prolonged and romantically successful adventure out of that
voyage to the Pacific which had been, in its origin, the last
despairing resource of the invalid.</p>

<p>Again, it was characteristic of this multiple personality
that he never seemed to be cramped like the rest of us,
at any given time of life, within the limits of his proper
age, but to be child, boy, young man, and old man all
at once. There was never a time in his life when Stevenson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxv"></a>xxxv</span>
had to say with St. Augustine, &ldquo;Behold! my childhood
is dead, but I am alive.&rdquo; The child lived on always
in him, not in memory only, but in real survival, with all
its freshness of perception unimpaired, and none of its
play instincts in the least degree extinguished or made
ashamed. As for the perennial boy in Stevenson, that is
too apparent to need remark. It was as a boy for boys
that he wrote the best known of his books, <i>Treasure Island</i>,
and with all boys that he met, provided they were really
boys and not prigs nor puppies, he was instantly and
delightedly at home. At the same time, even when I
first knew him, he showed already surprising occasional
traits and glimpses of old sagacity, of premature life-wisdom
and experience.</p>

<p>Once more, it is said that in every poet there must be
something of the woman. If to be quick in sympathy and
feeling, ardent in attachment, and full of pity for the
weak and suffering, is to be womanly, Stevenson was
certainly all those; he was even like a woman in being
<span class="grk" title="artidakrus">&#7936;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#948;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#962;</span>, easily moved to tears at the touch of pity
or affection, or even at any specially poignant impression
of art or beauty. But yet, if any one word were to be
chosen for the predominant quality of his character and
example, I suppose that word would be manly. In his
gentle and complying nature there were strains of iron
tenacity and will: occasionally even, let it be admitted,
of perversity and Scottish &ldquo;thrawnness.&rdquo; He had both
kinds of physical courage&mdash;the active, delighting in danger,
and the passive, unshaken in endurance. In the moral
courage of facing situations and consequences, of readiness
to pay for faults committed, of outspokenness, admitting
no ambiguous relations and clearing away the clouds
from human intercourse, I have not known his equal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxvi"></a>xxxvi</span>
The great Sir Walter himself, as this book will prove, was
not more manfully free from artistic jealousy or irritability
under criticism, or more unfeignedly inclined to exaggerate
the qualities of other people&rsquo;s work and to underrate those
of his own. Of the humorous and engaging parts of
vanity and egoism, which led him to make infinite talk
and fun about himself, and use his own experiences as a
key for unlocking the confidences of others, Stevenson
had plenty; but of the morose and fretful parts never
a shade. &ldquo;A little Irish girl,&rdquo; he wrote once during a
painful crisis of his life, &ldquo;is now reading my book aloud
to her sister at my elbow; they chuckle, and I feel flattered.&mdash;Yours,
R. L. S. <i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Now they yawn, and I am
indifferent. Such a wisely conceived thing is vanity.&rdquo; If
only vanity so conceived were commoner! And whatever
might be the abstract and philosophical value of that
somewhat grimly stoical conception of the universe, of
conduct and duty, at which in mature years he had arrived,
want of manliness is certainly not its fault. Take the
kind of maxims which he was accustomed to forge for his
own guidance:&mdash;&ldquo;Acts may be forgiven; not even God
can forgive the hanger-back.&rdquo; &ldquo;Choose the best, if you
can; or choose the worst; that which hangs in the wind
dangles from a gibbet.&rdquo; &ldquo;&rsquo;Shall I?&rsquo; said Feeble-mind;
and the echo said, &lsquo;Fie!&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;&rsquo;Do I love?&rsquo; said Loveless;
and the echo laughed.&rdquo; &ldquo;A fault known is a fault
cured to the strong; but to the weak it is a fetter riveted.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The mean man doubts, the great-hearted is deceived.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Great-heart was deceived. &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Great-heart.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&rsquo;I have not forgotten my umbrella,&rsquo; said the
careful man; but the lightning struck him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shame
had a fine bed, but where was slumber? Once he was in
jail he slept.&rdquo; With this moralist maxims meant actions;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxvii"></a>xxxvii</span>
and where shall we easily find a much manlier spirit of
wisdom than this?</p>

<p>There was yet another and very different side to Stevenson
which struck others more than it struck myself, namely,
that of the freakish or elvish, irresponsible madcap or
jester which sometimes appeared in him. It is true that
his demoniac quickness of wit and intelligence suggested
occasionally a &ldquo;spirit of air and fire&rdquo; rather than one of
earth; that he was abundantly given to all kinds of quirk
and laughter; and that there was no jest (saving the
unkind) he would not make and relish. The late Mr. J. A.
Symonds always called him Sprite; qualifying the name,
however, by the epithets &ldquo;most fantastic, but most
human.&rdquo; To me the essential humanity was always the
thing most apparent. In a fire well nourished of seasoned
ship-timber, the flames glance fantastically and of many
colours, but the glow at heart is ever deep and strong;
it was at such a glow that the friends of Stevenson were
accustomed to warm their hands, while they admired and
were entertained by the shifting lights.</p>

<p>It was only in company, as I have said, that all these
many lights and colours could be seen in full play. He
would begin no matter how&mdash;perhaps with a jest at some
absurd adventure of his own, perhaps with the recitation,
in his vibrating voice and full Scotch accent, of some
snatch of poetry that was haunting him, perhaps with a
rhapsody of analytic delight over some minute accident
of beauty or expressiveness that had struck him in man,
woman, child, or external nature. And forthwith the
floodgates would be opened, and the talk would stream
on in endless, never importunate, flood and variety. A
hundred fictitious characters would be invented and
launched on their imaginary careers; a hundred ingenious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxviii"></a>xxxviii</span>
problems of conduct and cases of honour would be set and
solved; romantic voyages would be planned and followed
out in vision, with a thousand incidents; the possibilities
of life and art would be illuminated with search-lights of
bewildering range and penetration, sober argument and
high poetic eloquence alternating with coruscations of
insanely apposite slang&mdash;the earthiest jape anon shooting
up into the empyrean and changing into the most ethereal
fantasy&mdash;the stalest and most vulgarised forms of speech
gaining brilliancy and illuminating power from some
hitherto undreamt-of application&mdash;and all the while
an atmosphere of goodwill diffusing itself from the
speaker, a glow of eager benignity and affectionate
laughter emanating from his presence, till every one
about him seemed to catch something of his own gift and
inspiration. This sympathetic power of inspiring others
was the special and distinguishing note of Stevenson&rsquo;s
conversation. He would keep a houseful or a single
companion entertained all day, and day after day and
half the nights, yet never seemed to monopolise the talk
or absorb it; rather he helped every one about him to
discover and to exercise unexpected powers of their
own.</p>

<p>Imagine all this helped by the most speaking of presences:
a steady, penetrating fire in the brown, wide-set
eyes, a compelling power and richness in the smile; courteous,
waving gestures of the arms and long, nervous hands,
a lit cigarette generally held between the fingers; continual
rapid shiftings and pacings to and fro as he conversed:
rapid, but not flurried nor awkward, for there
was a grace in his attenuated but well-carried figure, and
his movements were light, deft, and full of spring. There
was something for strangers, and even for friends, to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxix"></a>xxxix</span>
over in the queer garments which in youth it was his
whim to wear&mdash;the badge, as they always seemed to me,
partly of a genuine carelessness, certainly of a genuine
lack of cash (the little he had was always absolutely at
the disposal of his friends), partly of a deliberate detachment
from any particular social class or caste, partly of
his love of pickles and adventures, which he thought befel
a man thus attired more readily than another. But this
slender, slovenly, nondescript apparition, long-visaged and
long-haired, had only to speak in order to be recognised
in the first minute for a witty and charming gentleman,
and within the first five for a master spirit and man of
genius. There were, indeed, certain stolidly conventional
and superciliously official kinds of persons, both at home
and abroad, who were incapable of looking beyond the
clothes, and eyed him always with frozen suspicion. This
attitude used sometimes in youth to drive him into fits of
flaming anger, which put him helplessly at a disadvantage
unless, or until, he could call the sense of humour to his
help. Apart from these his human charm was the same
for all kinds of people, without distinction of class or
caste; for worldly-wise old great ladies, whom he reminded
of famous poets in their youth; for his brother artists
and men of letters, perhaps, above all; for the ordinary
clubman; for his physicians, who could never do enough
for him; for domestic servants, who adored him; for the
English policeman even, on whom he often tried, quite in
vain, to pass himself as one of the criminal classes; for
the shepherd, the street arab, or the tramp, the common
seaman, the beach-comber, or the Polynesian high-chief.
Even in the imposed silence and restraint of extreme sickness
the power and attraction of the man made themselves
felt, and there seemed to be more vitality and fire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexl"></a>xl</span>
of the spirit in him as he lay exhausted and speechless in
bed than in an ordinary roomful of people in health.</p>

<p>But I have strayed from my purpose, which was only
to indicate that in the best of these letters of Stevenson&rsquo;s
you have some echo, far away indeed, but yet the nearest,
of his talk&mdash;talk which could not possibly be taken down,
and of which nothing remains save in the memory of his
friends an impression magical and never to be effaced.</p>

favourable to me and contrary to others, I would rather be misunderstood

be doubted.</p>

<h6>1868-1873</h6>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> following section consists chiefly of extracts from
the correspondence and journals addressed by Louis
Stevenson, as a lad of eighteen to twenty-two, to his
father and mother during summer excursions to the
Scottish coast or to the Continent. There exist enough
of them to fill a volume; but it is not in letters of this
kind to his family that a young man unbosoms himself
most freely, and these are perhaps not quite devoid of the
qualities of the guide-book and the descriptive exercise.
Nevertheless they seem to me to contain enough signs
of the future master-writer, enough of character, observation,
and skill in expression, to make a certain number
worth giving by way of an opening chapter to the present
book. Among them are interspersed four or five of a
different character addressed to other correspondents,
and chiefly to his lifelong friend and intimate, Mr. Charles
Baxter.</p>

<p>On both sides of the house Stevenson came of interesting
stock. His grandfather was Robert Stevenson, civil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>4</span>
engineer, highly distinguished as the builder of the Bell
Rock lighthouse. By this Robert Stevenson, his three
sons, and two of his grandsons now living, the business
of civil engineers in general, and of official engineers to
the Commissioners of Northern Lights in particular, has
been carried on at Edinburgh with high credit and public
utility for almost a century. Thomas Stevenson, the
youngest of the three sons of the original Robert, was
Robert Louis Stevenson&rsquo;s father. He was a man not
only of mark, zeal, and inventiveness in his profession,
but of a strong and singular personality; a staunch friend
and sagacious adviser, trenchant in judgment and demonstrative
in emotion, outspoken, dogmatic,&mdash;despotic, even,
in little things, but withal essentially chivalrous and soft-hearted;
apt to pass with the swiftest transition from
moods of gloom or sternness to those of tender or freakish
gaiety, and commanding a gift of humorous and figurative
speech second only to that of his more famous son.</p>

<p>Thomas Stevenson was married to Margaret Isabella,
youngest daughter of the Rev. Lewis Balfour, for many
years minister of the parish of Colinton in Midlothian.
This Mr. Balfour (described by his grandson in the essay
called <i>The Manse</i>) was of the stock of the Balfours of
Pilrig, and grandson to that James Balfour, professor
first of moral philosophy and afterwards of the law of
nature and of nations, who was held in particular esteem
as a philosophical controversialist by David Hume. His
wife, Henrietta Smith, a daughter of the Rev. George
Smith of Galston, to whose gift as a preacher Burns refers
scoffingly in the <i>Holy Fair</i>, is said to have been a woman
of uncommon beauty and charm of manner. Their
daughter, Mrs. Thomas Stevenson, suffered in early and
middle life from chest and nerve troubles, and her son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>5</span>
may have inherited from her some of his constitutional
weakness. Capable, cultivated, companionable, affectionate,
she was a determined looker at the bright side of things,
and hence better skilled, perhaps, to shut her eyes to
troubles or differences among those she loved than understandingly
to compose or heal them. Conventionally
minded one might have thought her, but for the surprising
readiness with which in later life she adapted herself to
conditions of life and travel the most unconventional
possible. The son and only child of these two, Robert
Louis (baptized Robert Lewis Balfour<a name="FnAnchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a>), was born on
November 13, 1850, at 8 Howard Place, Edinburgh. His
health was infirm from the first, and he was with difficulty
kept alive by the combined care of his mother and a most
devoted nurse, Alison Cunningham; to whom his lifelong
gratitude will be found touchingly expressed in the
course of the following letters. In 1858 he was near
dying of a gastric fever, and was at all times subject to
acute catarrhal and bronchial affections and extreme
nervous excitability.</p>

<p>In January 1853 Stevenson&rsquo;s parents moved to Inverleith
Terrace, and in May 1857 to 17 Heriot Row, which
continued to be their Edinburgh home until the death
of Thomas Stevenson in 1887. Much of the boy&rsquo;s time
was also spent in the manse of Colinton on the Water of
Leith, the home of his maternal grandfather. Ill-health
prevented him getting much regular or continuous schooling.
He attended first (1858-61) a preparatory school
kept by a Mr. Henderson in India Street; and next (at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>6</span>
intervals for some time after the autumn of 1861) the
Edinburgh Academy.</p>

<p>Schooling was interrupted in the end of 1862 and
first half of 1863 by excursions with his parents to Germany,
the Riviera, and Italy. The love of wandering,
which was a rooted passion in Stevenson&rsquo;s nature, thus
began early to find satisfaction. For a few months in
the autumn of 1863, when his parents had been ordered
for a second time to Mentone for the sake of his mother&rsquo;s
health, he was sent to a boarding-school kept by a Mr.
Wyatt at Spring Grove, near London. It is not my
intention to treat the reader to the series of childish and
boyish letters of these days which parental fondness has
preserved. But here is one written from his English
school when he was about thirteen, which is both amusing
in itself and had a certain influence on his destiny, inasmuch
as his appeal led to his being taken out to join his
parents on the French Riviera; which from these days
of his boyhood he never ceased to love, and for which the
longing, amid the gloom of Edinburgh winters, often
afterwards gripped him by the heart.</p>

<p>This young French scholar has yet, it will be discerned,
a good way to travel; in later days he acquired a complete
reading and speaking, with a less complete writing,
mastery of the language, and was as much at home with
French ways of thought and life as with English.</p>

<p>For one more specimen of his boyish style, it may be
not amiss to give the text of another appeal which dates
from two and a half years later, and is also typical of
much in his life&rsquo;s conditions both then and later:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>8</span></p>

<p>From 1864 to 1867 Stevenson&rsquo;s education was conducted
chiefly at Mr. Thomson&rsquo;s private school in Frederick
Street, Edinburgh, and by private tutors in various places
to which he travelled for his own or his parents&rsquo; health.
These travels included frequent visits to such Scottish
health resorts as Bridge of Allan, Dunoon, Rothesay,
North Berwick, Lasswade, and Peebles, and occasional
excursions with his father on his nearer professional rounds
to the Scottish coasts and lighthouses. From 1867 the
family life became more settled between Edinburgh and
Swanston Cottage, Lothianburn, a country home in the
Pentlands which Mr. Stevenson first rented in that year,
and the scenery and associations of which sank deeply
into the young man&rsquo;s spirit, and vitally affected his after
thoughts and his art.</p>

<p>By this time Louis Stevenson seemed to show signs
of outgrowing his early infirmities of health. He was a
lover, to a degree even beyond his strength, of outdoor
life and exercise (though not of sports), and it began to
be hoped that as he grew up he would be fit to enter the
family profession of civil engineer. He was accordingly
entered as a student at Edinburgh University, and for
several winters attended classes there with such regularity
as his health and inclinations permitted. This was in
truth but small. The mind on fire with its own imaginations,
and eager to acquire its own experiences in its own
way, does not take kindly to the routine of classes and
repetitions, nor could the desultory mode of schooling
enforced upon him by ill-health answer much purpose by
way of discipline. According to his own account he was
at college, as he had been at school, an inveterate idler
and truant. But outside the field of school and college
routine he showed an eager curiosity and activity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>9</span>
mind. &ldquo;He was of a conversable temper,&rdquo; so he says
of himself, &ldquo;and insatiably curious in the aspects of life,
and spent much of his time scraping acquaintance with
all classes of men and womenkind.&rdquo; Of one class indeed,
and that was his own, he had soon had enough, at least
in so far as it was to be studied at the dinners, dances,
and other polite entertainments of ordinary Edinburgh
society. Of these he early wearied. At home he made
himself pleasant to all comers, but for his own resort
chose out a very few houses, mostly those of intimate
college companions, into which he could go without constraint,
and where his inexhaustible flow of poetic, imaginative,
and laughing talk seems generally to have rather
puzzled his hearers than impressed them. On the other
hand, during his endless private rambles and excursions,
whether among the streets and slums, the gardens and
graveyards of the city, or farther afield among the Pentland
hills or on the shores of Forth, he was never tired
of studying character and seeking acquaintance among
the classes more nearly exposed to the pinch and stress
of life.</p>

<p>In the eyes of anxious elders, such vagrant ways naturally
take on the colours of idleness and a love of low company.
Stevenson was, however, in his own fashion an
eager student of books as well as of man and nature. He
read precociously and omnivorously in the <i>belles-lettres</i>,
including a very wide range of English poetry, fiction,
and essays, and a fairly wide range of French; and was
a genuine student of Scottish history, especially from
the time of the persecutions down, and to some extent
of history in general. The art of literature was already
his private passion, and something within him even already
told him that it was to be his life&rsquo;s work. On all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>10</span>
truantries he went pencil and copybook in hand, trying
to fit his impression of the scene to words, to compose
original rhymes, tales, dialogues, and dramas, or to imitate
the style and cadences of the author he at the moment
preferred. For three or four years, nevertheless, he tried
dutifully, if half-heartedly, to prepare himself for the
family profession. In 1868, the year when the following
correspondence opens, he went to watch the works of the
firm in progress first at Anstruther on the coast of Fife,
and afterwards at Wick. In 1869 he made the tour of
the Orkneys and Shetlands on board the steam yacht
of the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and in 1870
the tour of the Western Islands, preceded by a stay on
the isle of Earraid, where the works of the Dhu Heartach
lighthouse were then in progress. He was a favourite,
although a very irregular, pupil of the professor of engineering,
Fleeming Jenkin, whose friendship and that of
Mrs. Jenkin were of great value to him, and whose life
he afterwards wrote; and must have shown some aptitude
for the family calling, inasmuch as in 1871 he received
the silver medal of the Edinburgh Society of Arts for a
paper on a suggested improvement in lighthouse apparatus.
The outdoor and seafaring parts of an engineer&rsquo;s life were
in fact wholly to his taste. But he looked instinctively
at the powers and phenomena of waves and tide, of storm
and current, reef, cliff, and rock, with the eye of the poet
and artist, and not those of the practician and calculator.
For desk work and office routine he had an unconquerable
aversion; and his physical powers, had they remained
at their best, must have proved quite unequal to the
workshop training necessary to the practical engineer.
Accordingly in 1871 it was agreed, not without natural
reluctance on his father&rsquo;s part, that he should give up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>11</span>
the hereditary vocation and read for the bar: literature,
on which his heart was set, and in which his early attempts
had been encouraged, being held to be by itself no profession,
or at least one altogether too irregular and undefined.
For the next several years, therefore, he attended
law classes instead of engineering and science classes in
the University, giving to the subject a certain amount
of serious, although fitful, attention until he was called
to the bar in 1875.</p>

<p>So much for the course of Stevenson&rsquo;s outward life
during these days at Edinburgh. To tell the story of his
inner life would be a far more complicated task, and cannot
here be attempted even briefly. The ferment of youth
was more acute and more prolonged in him than in most
men even of genius. In the Introduction I have tried
to give some notion of the many various strains and
elements which met in him, and which were in these days
pulling one against another in his half-formed being, at
a great expense of spirit and body. Add the storms,
which from time to time attacked him, of shivering repulsion
from the climate and conditions of life in the city
which he yet deeply and imaginatively loved; the moods
of spiritual revolt against the harsh doctrines of the creed
in which he had been brought up, and to which his parents
were deeply, his father even passionately, attached; the
seasons of temptation, to which he was exposed alike
by temperament and circumstance, to seek solace among
the crude allurements of the city streets.</p>

<p>In the later and maturer correspondence which will
appear in these volumes, the agitations of the writer&rsquo;s
early days are often enough referred to in retrospect.
In the boyish letters to his parents, which make up the
chief part of this first section, they naturally find no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>12</span>
expression at all; nor will these letters be found to differ
much in any way from those of any other lively and
observant lad who is also something of a reader and has
some natural gift of writing. At the end of the section
I have indeed printed one cry of the heart, written not
to his parents, but about them, and telling of the strain
which matters of religious difference for a while brought
into his home relations. The attachment between the
father and son from childhood was exceptionally strong.
But the father was staunchly wedded to the hereditary
creeds and dogmas of Scottish Calvinistic Christianity;
while the course of the young man&rsquo;s reading, with the
spirit of the generation in which he grew up, had loosed
him from the bonds of that theology, and even of dogmatic
Christianity in general, and had taught him to
respect all creeds alike as expressions of the cravings and
conjectures of the human spirit in face of the unsolved
mystery of things, rather than to cling to any one of them
as a revelation of ultimate truth. The shock to the father
was great when his son&rsquo;s opinions came to his knowledge;
and there ensued a time of extremely painful discussion
and private tension between them. In due time this
cloud upon a family life otherwise very harmonious and
affectionate passed quite away. But the greater the love,
the greater the pain; when I first knew Stevenson this
trouble gave him no peace, and it has left a strong trace
upon his mind and work. See particularly the parable
called &ldquo;The House of Eld,&rdquo; in his collection of <i>Fables</i>,
and the many studies of difficult paternal and filial relations
which are to be found in <i>The Story of a Lie</i>, <i>The Misadventures
of John Nicholson</i>, <i>The Wrecker</i>, and <i>Weir of
Hermiston</i>.</p>

Anstruther and afterwards those at Wick. Of his private moods

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;My lodgings are very nice, and I
don&rsquo;t think there are any children. There is a box of
mignonette in the window and a factory of dried rose-leaves,
which make the atmosphere a trifle heavy, but
very pleasant.</p>

<p>When you come, bring also my paint-box&mdash;I forgot it.
I am going to try the travellers and jennies, and have
made a sketch of them and begun the drawing. After
that I&rsquo;ll do the staging.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown &ldquo;has suffered herself from her stommick,
and that makes her kind of think for other people.&rdquo; She
is a motherly lot. Her mothering and thought for others
displays itself in advice against hard-boiled eggs, well-done
meat, and late dinners, these being my only requests.
Fancy&mdash;I am the only person in Anstruther who dines in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>If you could bring me some wine when you come,
&rsquo;twould be a good move: I fear <i>vin d&rsquo;Anstruther</i>; and
having procured myself a severe attack of gripes by two
days&rsquo; total abstinence on chilly table beer I have been forced
to purchase Green Ginger (&ldquo;Somebody or other&rsquo;s &lsquo;celebrated&rsquo;&ldquo;),
for the benefit of my stomach, like St. Paul.</p>

<p>There is little or nothing doing here to be seen. By
heightening the corner in a hurry to support the staging
they have let the masons get ahead of the divers and wait
till they can overtake them. I wish you would write and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>14</span>
put me up to the sort of things to ask and find out. I
received your registered letter with the £5; it will last
for ever. To-morrow I will watch the masons at the
pier-foot and see how long they take to work that Fifeness
stone you ask about; they get sixpence an hour;
so that is the only datum required.</p>

<p>It is awful how slowly I draw, and how ill: I am
not nearly done with the travellers, and have not thought
of the jennies yet. When I&rsquo;m drawing I find out something
I have not measured, or, having measured, have
not noted, or, having noted, cannot find; and so I have
to trudge to the pier again ere I can go farther with my
noble design.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;To-night I went with the youngest
M. to see a strolling band of players in the townhall. A
large table placed below the gallery with a print curtain
on either side of the most limited dimensions was at once
the scenery and the proscenium. The manager told us
that his scenes were sixteen by sixty-four, and so could
not be got in. Though I knew, or at least felt sure, that
there were no such scenes in the poor man&rsquo;s possession,
I could not laugh, as did the major part of the audience,
at this shift to escape criticism. We saw a wretched farce,
and some comic songs were sung. The manager sang one,
but it came grimly from his throat. The whole receipt
of the evening was 5s. and 3d., out of which had to come
room, gas, and town drummer. We left soon; and I
must say came out as sad as I have been for ever so long:
I think that manager had a soul above comic songs.
I said this to young M., who is a &ldquo;Phillistine&rdquo; (Matthew
Arnold&rsquo;s Philistine you understand), and he replied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>15</span>
&ldquo;How much happier would he be as a common working-man!&rdquo;
I told him I thought he would be less happy
earning a comfortable living as a shoemaker than he was
starving as an actor, with such artistic work as he had
to do. But the Phillistine wouldn&rsquo;t see it. You observe
that I spell Philistine time about with one and two l&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>As we went home we heard singing, and went into the
porch of the schoolhouse to listen. A fisherman entered
and told us to go in. It was a psalmody class. One of the
girls had a glorious voice. We stayed for half an hour.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I am utterly sick of this grey, grim, sea-beaten
hole. I have a little cold in my head, which makes
my eyes sore; and you can&rsquo;t tell how utterly sick I am,
and how anxious to get back among trees and flowers and
something less meaningless than this bleak fertility.</p>

<p>Papa need not imagine that I have a bad cold or am
stone-blind from this description, which is the whole truth.</p>

<p>Last night Mr. and Mrs. Fortune called in a dog-cart,
Fortune&rsquo;s beard and Mrs. F.&rsquo;s brow glittering with mist-drops,
to ask me to come next Saturday. Conditionally,
I accepted. Do you think I can cut it? I am only anxious
to go slick home on the Saturday. Write by return of
post and tell me what to do. If possible, I should like to
cut the business and come right slick out to Swanston.&mdash;I
remain, your affectionate son,</p>

<p>An early Portfolio paper On <i>the Enjoyment of Unpleasant Places</i>,
as well as the second part of the <i>Random Memories</i> essay, written
twenty years later, refer to the same experiences as the following
letters. Stevenson lodged during his stay at Wick in a private
hotel on the Harbour Brae, kept by a Mr. Sutherland.<a name="FnAnchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Wick, Friday, September 11, 1868.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash; ... Wick lies at the end or
elbow of an open triangular bay, hemmed on either side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>16</span>
by shores, either cliff or steep earth-bank, of no great
height. The grey houses of Pulteney extend along the
southerly shore almost to the cape; and it is about half-way
down this shore&mdash;no, six-sevenths way down&mdash;that
the new breakwater extends athwart the bay.</p>

<p>Certainly Wick in itself possesses no beauty: bare,
grey shores, grim grey houses, grim grey sea; not even
the gleam of red tiles; not even the greenness of a tree.
The southerly heights, when I came here, were black with
people, fishers waiting on wind and night. Now all the
S.Y.S. (Stornoway boats) have beaten out of the bay,
and the Wick men stay indoors or wrangle on the quays
with dissatisfied fish-curers, knee-high in brine, mud, and
herring refuse. The day when the boats put out to go
home to the Hebrides, the girl here told me there was &ldquo;a
black wind&ldquo;; and on going out, I found the epithet as
justifiable as it was picturesque. A cold, <i>black</i> southerly
wind, with occasional rising showers of rain; it was a fine
sight to see the boats beat out a-teeth of it.</p>

<p>In Wick I have never heard any one greet his neighbour
with the usual &ldquo;Fine day&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo; Both
come shaking their heads, and both say, &ldquo;Breezy, breezy!&rdquo;
And such is the atrocious quality of the climate, that the
remark is almost invariably justified by the fact.</p>

<p>The streets are full of the Highland fishers, lubberly,
stupid, inconceivably lazy and heavy to move. You
bruise against them, tumble over them, elbow them against
the wall&mdash;all to no purpose; they will not budge; and
you are forced to leave the pavement every step.</p>

<p>To the south, however, is as fine a piece of coast scenery
as I ever saw. Great black chasms, huge black cliffs,
rugged and over-hung gullies, natural arches, and deep
green pools below them, almost too deep to let you see the
gleam of sand among the darker weed: there are deep
caves too. In one of these lives a tribe of gipsies. The
men are <i>always</i> drunk, simply and truthfully always.
From morning to evening the great villainous-looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>17</span>
fellows are either sleeping off the last debauch, or hulking
about the cove &ldquo;in the horrors.&rdquo; The cave is deep, high,
and airy, and might be made comfortable enough. But
they just live among heaped boulders, damp with continual
droppings from above, with no more furniture than
two or three tin pans, a truss of rotten straw, and a few
ragged cloaks. In winter the surf bursts into the mouth
and often forces them to abandon it.</p>

<p>An <i>émeute</i> of disappointed fishers was feared, and two
ships of war are in the bay to render assistance to the
municipal authorities. This is the ides; and, to all intents
and purposes, said ides are passed. Still there is a good
deal of disturbance, many drunk men, and a double supply
of police. I saw them sent for by some people and enter
an inn, in a pretty good hurry: what it was for I do not
know.</p>

<p>You would see by papa&rsquo;s letter about the carpenter
who fell off the staging: I don&rsquo;t think I was ever so much
excited in my life. The man was back at his work, and
I asked him how he was; but he was a Highlander, and&mdash;need
I add it?&mdash;dickens a word could I understand of
his answer. What is still worse, I find the people here-about&mdash;that
is to say, the Highlanders, not the northmen&mdash;don&rsquo;t
understand <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>I have lost a shilling&rsquo;s worth of postage stamps, which
has damped my ardour for buying big lots of &rsquo;em: I&rsquo;ll
buy them one at a time as I want &rsquo;em for the future.</p>

<p>The Free Church minister and I got quite thick. He
left last night about two in the morning, when I went
to turn in. He gave me the enclosed.&mdash;I remain your

&ldquo;Are we to have no sleep at all for that <i>drunken brute?</i>&rdquo;
I said. As I hoped, it had the desired effect. &ldquo;Drunken
brute!&rdquo; he howled, in much indignation; then after a
pause, in a voice of some contrition, &ldquo;Well, if I am a
drunken brute, it&rsquo;s only once in the twelvemonth!&rdquo; And
that was the end of him; the insult rankled in his mind;
and he retired to rest. He is a fish-curer, a man over
fifty, and pretty rich too. He&rsquo;s as bad again to-day;

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;The last two days have been
dreadfully hard, and I was so tired in the evenings that
I could not write. In fact, last night I went to sleep
immediately after dinner, or very nearly so. My hours
have been 10-2 and 3-7 out in the lighter or the small
boat, in a long, heavy roll from the nor&rsquo;-east. When the
dog was taken out, he got awfully ill; one of the men,
Geordie Grant by name and surname, followed <i>shoot</i> with
considerable <i>éclat</i>; but, wonderful to relate! I kept well.
My hands are all skinned, blistered, discoloured, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>20</span>
engrained with tar, some of which latter has established
itself under my nails in a position of such natural strength
that it defies all my efforts to dislodge it. The worst
work I had was when David (Macdonald&rsquo;s eldest) and I
took the charge ourselves. He remained in the lighter to
tighten or slacken the guys as we raised the pole towards
the perpendicular, with two men. I was with four men
in the boat. We dropped an anchor out a good bit, then
tied a cord to the pole, took a turn round the sternmost
thwart with it, and pulled on the anchor line. As the
great, big, wet hawser came in it soaked you to the skin:
I was the sternest (used, by way of variety, for sternmost)
of the lot, and had to coil it&mdash;a work which involved, from
<i>its</i> being so stiff and <i>your</i> being busy pulling with all your
might, no little trouble and an extra ducking. We got it
up; and, just as we were going to sing &ldquo;Victory!&rdquo; one
of the guys slipped in, the pole tottered&mdash;went over on
its side again like a shot, and behold the end of our
labour.</p>

<p>You see, I have been roughing it; and though some
parts of the letter may be neither very comprehensible
nor very interesting to <i>you</i>, I think that perhaps it might
amuse Willie Traquair, who delights in all such dirty
jobs.</p>

<p>The first day, I forgot to mention, was like mid-winter
for cold, and rained incessantly so hard that the livid
white of our cold-pinched faces wore a sort of inflamed
rash on the windward side.</p>

<p>I am not a bit the worse of it, except fore-mentioned
state of hands, a slight crick in my neck from the rain
running down, and general stiffness from pulling, hauling,
and tugging for dear life.</p>

<p>We have got double weights at the guys, and hope
to get it up like a shot.</p>

<p>What fun you three must be having! I hope the cold
don&rsquo;t disagree with you.&mdash;I remain, my dear mother, your

to come back&mdash;&ldquo;any night you feel dull: and any night
doesn&rsquo;t mean no night: we&rsquo;ll be so glad to see you.&rdquo;
<i>C&rsquo;est la mère qui parle.</i></p>

<p>I was back there again to-night. There was hymn-singing,
and general religious controversy till eight, after
which talk was secular. Mrs. Sutherland was deeply
distressed about the boot business. She consoled me
by saying that many would be glad to have such feet
whatever shoes they had on. Unfortunately, fishers
and seafaring men are too facile to be compared
with! This looks like enjoyment! better speck than
Anster.</p>

<p>I have done with frivolity. This morning I was
awakened by Mrs. Sutherland at the door. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ship
ashore at Shaltigoe!&rdquo; As my senses slowly flooded, I heard
the whistling and the roaring of wind, and the lashing
of gust-blown and uncertain flaws of rain. I got up,
dressed, and went out. The mizzled sky and rain blinded
you.</p>

<p>She was a Norwegian: coming in she saw our first
gauge-pole, standing at point E. Norse skipper thought
it was a sunk smack, and dropped his anchor in full drift of
sea: chain broke: schooner came ashore. Insured: laden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>23</span>
with wood: skipper owner of vessel and cargo: bottom
out.</p>

<p>I was in a great fright at first lest we should be liable;
but it seems that&rsquo;s all right.</p>

<p>C D is the new pier.</p>

<p>A the schooner ashore. B the salmon house.</p>

<p>Some of the waves were twenty feet high. The spray
rose eighty feet at the new pier. Some wood has come
ashore, and the roadway seems carried away. There is
something fishy at the far end where the cross wall is
building; but till we are able to get along, all speculation
is vain.</p>

<p>I am so sleepy I am writing nonsense.</p>

<p>I stood a long while on the cope watching the sea
below me; I hear its dull, monotonous roar at this moment
below the shrieking of the wind; and there came ever
recurring to my mind the verse I am so fond of:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;But yet the Lord that is on high</p>
<p class="i1">Is more of might by far</p>
<p class="i05">Than noise of many waters is</p>
<p class="i1">Or great sea-billows are.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The thunder at the wall when it first struck&mdash;the rush
along ever growing higher&mdash;the great jet of snow-white
spray some forty feet above you&mdash;and the &ldquo;noise of
many waters,&rdquo; the roar, the hiss, the &ldquo;shrieking&rdquo; among
the shingle as it fell head over heels at your feet. I
watched if it threw the big stones at the wall; but it
never moved them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>24</span></p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;The end of the work displays gaps, cairns
of ten ton blocks, stones torn from their places and turned
right round. The damage above water is comparatively
little: what there may be below, on <i>ne sait pas encore</i>.
The roadway is torn away, cross-heads, broken planks
tossed here and there, planks gnawn and mumbled as if
a starved bear had been trying to eat them, planks with
spates lifted from them as if they had been dressed with
a rugged plane, one pile swaying to and fro clear of the
bottom, the rails in one place sunk a foot at least. This
was not a great storm, the waves were light and short.
Yet when we are standing at the office, I felt the ground
beneath me <i>quail</i> as a huge roller thundered on the work
at the last year&rsquo;s cross wall.</p>

<p>How could <i>noster amicus Q. maximus</i> appreciate a
storm at Wick? It requires a little of the artistic temperament,
of which Mr. T. S.,<a name="FnAnchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> C.E., possesses some, whatever
he may say. I can&rsquo;t look at it practically however:
that will come, I suppose, like grey hair or coffin nails.</p>

<p>Our pole is snapped: a fortnight&rsquo;s work and the loss
of the Norse schooner all for nothing!&mdash;except experience
and dirty clothes.&mdash;Your affectionate son,</p>

<p>I omit the letters of 1869, which describe at great length, and
not very interestingly, a summer trip on board the lighthouse
steamer to the Orkneys, Shetlands, and the Fair Isle. The following
of 1870 I give (by consent of the lady who figures as a youthful
character in the narrative) both for the sake of its lively social
sketches&mdash;including that of the able painter and singular personage,
the late Sam Bough,&mdash;and because it is dated from the Isle of
Earraid, celebrated alike in <i>Kidnapped</i> and in the essay <i>Memoirs
of an Islet</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Earraid, Thursday, August 5th, 1870.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;I have so much to say, that needs
must I take a large sheet; for the notepaper brings with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>25</span>
it a chilling brevity of style. Indeed, I think pleasant
writing is proportional to the size of the material you
write withal.</p>

<p>From Edinburgh to Greenock, I had the ex-secretary
of the E.U. Conservative Club, Murdoch. At Greenock
I spent a dismal evening, though I found a pretty walk.
Next day on board the <i>Iona</i>, I had Maggie Thomson to
Tarbet; Craig, a well-read, pleasant medical, to Ardrishaig;
and Professor, Mrs., and all the little Fleeming Jenkinseses
to Oban.</p>

<p>At Oban, that night, it was delicious. Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s
yacht lay in the bay, and a splendid band on board played
delightfully. The waters of the bay were as smooth as
a mill-pond; and, in the dusk, the black shadows of the
hills stretched across to our very feet and the lights were
reflected in long lines. At intervals, blue lights were
burned on the water; and rockets were sent up. Sometimes
great stars of clear fire fell from them, until the
bay received and quenched them. I hired a boat and
skulled round the yacht in the dark. When I came in,
a very pleasant Englishman on the steps fell into talk
with me, till it was time to go to bed.</p>

<p>Next morning I slept on or I should have gone to
Glencoe. As it was, it was blazing hot; so I hired a boat,
pulled all forenoon along the coast and had a delicious
bathe on a beautiful white beach. Coming home, I
<i>cotogai&rsquo;d</i> my Englishman, lunched alongside of him and
his sister, and took a walk with him in the afternoon,
during which I find that he was travelling with a servant,
kept horses, <i>et cetera</i>. At dinner he wished me to sit
beside him and his sister; but there was no room. When
he came out he told me why he was so <i>empressé</i> on this
point. He had found out my name, and that I was connected
with lighthouses, and his sister wished to know
if I were any relative of the Stevenson in Ballantyne&rsquo;s
<i>Lighthouse</i>. All evening, he, his sister, I, and Mr. Hargrove,
of Hargrove and Fowler, sate in front of the hotel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>26</span>
I asked Mr. H. if he knew who my friend was. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;I never met him before: but my partner knows
him. He is a man of old family; and the solicitor of
highest standing about Sheffield.&rdquo; At night he said,
&ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;re down in my neighbourhood, you must
pay me a visit. I am very fond of young men about me;
and I should like a visit from you very much. I can take
you through any factory in Sheffield and I&rsquo;ll drive you
all about the <i>Dookeries</i>.&rdquo; He then wrote me down his
address; and we parted huge friends, he still keeping me
up to visiting him.</p>

<p>Hitherto, I had enjoyed myself amazingly; but to-day
has been the crown. In the morning I met Bough on
board, with whom I am both surprised and delighted.
He and I have read the same books, and discuss Chaucer,
Shakespeare, Marlowe, Fletcher, Webster, and all the old
authors. He can quote verses by the page, and has really
a very pretty literary taste. Altogether, with all his
roughness and buffoonery, a more pleasant, clever fellow
you may seldom see. I was very much surprised with
him; and he with me. &ldquo;Where the devil did you read
all these books?&rdquo; says he; and in my heart, I echo
the question. One amusing thing I must say. We were
both talking about travelling; and I said I was so fond
of travelling alone, from the people one met and grew
friendly with. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve such a pleasant
manner, you know&mdash;quite captivated my old woman, you
did&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t talk of anything else.&rdquo; Here was a
compliment, even in Sam Bough&rsquo;s sneering tones, that
rather tickled my vanity; and really, my social successes
of the last few days, the best of which is yet to come,
are enough to turn anybody&rsquo;s head. To continue, after
a little go in with Samuel, he going up on the bridge,
I looked about me to see who there was; and mine eye
lighted on two girls, one of whom was sweet and pretty,
talking to an old gentleman. &ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>,&rdquo; says I to myself,
&ldquo;that seems the best investment on board.&rdquo; So I sidled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>27</span>
up to the old gentleman, got into conversation with him
and so with the damsel; and thereupon, having used the
patriarch as a ladder, I kicked him down behind me.
Who should my damsel prove, but Amy Sinclair, daughter
of Sir Tollemache. She certainly was the simplest, most
naïve specimen of girlhood ever I saw. By getting brandy
and biscuit and generally coaching up her cousin, who
was sick, I ingratiated myself; and so kept her the whole
way to Iona, taking her into the cave at Staffa and
generally making myself as gallant as possible. I was
never so much pleased with anything in my life, as her
amusing absence of <i>mauvaise honte</i>: she was so sorry I
wasn&rsquo;t going on to Oban again: didn&rsquo;t know how she
could have enjoyed herself if I hadn&rsquo;t been there; and was
so sorry we hadn&rsquo;t met on the Crinan. When we came
back from Staffa, she and her aunt went down to have
lunch; and a minute after up comes Miss Amy to ask
me if I wouldn&rsquo;t think better of it, and take some lunch
with them. I couldn&rsquo;t resist that, of course; so down I
went; and there she displayed the full extent of her
innocence. I must be sure to come to Thurso Castle the
next time I was in Caithness, and Upper Norwood (whence
she would take me all over the Crystal Palace) when I
was near London; and (most complete of all) she offered
to call on us in Edinburgh! Wasn&rsquo;t it delicious?&mdash;she is
a girl of sixteen or seventeen, too, and the latter I think.
I never yet saw a girl so innocent and fresh, so perfectly
modest without the least trace of prudery.</p>

<p>Coming off Staffa, Sam Bough (who had been in huge
force the whole time, drawing in Miss Amy&rsquo;s sketchbook
and making himself agreeable or otherwise to everybody)
pointed me out to a parson and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;
This was Alexander Ross and his wife.</p>

<p>The last stage of the steamer now approached, Miss
Amy and I lamenting pathetically that Iona was so near.
&ldquo;People meet in this way,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;and then lose
sight of one another so soon.&rdquo; We all landed together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>28</span>
Bough and I and the Rosses with our baggage; and
went together over the ruins. I was here left with the
cousin and the aunt, during which I learned that said
cousin sees me <i>every Sunday</i> in St. Stephen&rsquo;s. Oho!
thought I, at the &ldquo;every.&rdquo; The aunt was very anxious
to know who that strange, wild man was? (didn&rsquo;t I wish
Samuel in Tophet!). Of course, in reply, I drew it strong
about eccentric genius and my never having known him
before, and a good deal that was perhaps &ldquo;strained to
the extremest limit of the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The steamer left, and Miss Amy and her cousin waved
their handkerchiefs, until my arm in answering them was
nearly broken. I believe women&rsquo;s arms must be better
made for this exercise: mine ache still; and I regretted
at the time that the handkerchief had seen service.
Altogether, however, I was left in a pleasant frame of
mind.</p>

<p>Being thus left alone, Bough, I, the Rosses, Professor
Blackie, and an Englishman called M&mdash;&mdash;: these people
were going to remain the night, except the Professor, who
is resident there at present. They were going to dine
<i>en compagnie</i> and wished us to join the party; but we
had already committed ourselves by mistake to the wrong
hotel, and besides, we wished to be off as soon as wind
and tide were against us to Earraid. We went up; Bough
selected a place for sketching and blocked in the sketch
for Mrs. R.; and we all talked together. Bough told us
his family history and a lot of strange things about old
Cumberland life; among others, how he had known &ldquo;John
Peel&rdquo; of pleasant memory in song, and of how that worthy
hunted. At five, down we go to the Argyll Hotel, and
wait dinner. Broth&mdash;&ldquo;nice broth&ldquo;&mdash;fresh herrings, and
fowl had been promised. At 5.50, I get the shovel and
tongs and drum them at the stair-head till a response
comes from below that the nice broth is at hand. I boast
of my engineering, and Bough compares me to the Abbot
of Arbroath who originated the Inchcape Bell. At last,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>29</span>
in comes the tureen and the hand-maid lifts the cover.
&ldquo;Rice soup!&rdquo; I yell; &ldquo;O no! none o&rsquo; that for me!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
says Bough savagely; &ldquo;but Miss Amy didn&rsquo;t
take <i>me</i> downstairs to eat salmon.&rdquo; Accordingly he is
helped. How his face fell. &ldquo;I imagine myself in the
accident ward of the Infirmary,&rdquo; quoth he. It was, purely
and simply, rice and water. After this, we have another
weary pause, and then herrings in a state of mash and
potatoes like iron. &ldquo;Send the potatoes out to Prussia
for grape-shot,&rdquo; was the suggestion. I dined off broken
herrings and dry bread. At last &ldquo;the supreme moment
comes,&rdquo; and the fowl in a lordly dish is carried in. On
the cover being raised, there is something so forlorn and
miserable about the aspect of the animal that we both
roar with laughter. Then Bough, taking up knife and
fork, turns the &ldquo;swarry&rdquo; over and over, shaking doubtfully
his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an aspect of quiet resistance
about the beggar,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that looks bad.&rdquo; However,
to work he falls until the sweat stands on his brow and
a dismembered leg falls, dull and leaden-like, on to my
dish. To eat it was simply impossible. I did not know
before that flesh could be so tough. &ldquo;The strongest
jaws in England,&rdquo; says Bough piteously, harpooning his
dry morsel, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t eat this leg in less than twelve
hours.&rdquo; Nothing for it now, but to order boat and bill.
&ldquo;That fowl,&rdquo; says Bough to the landlady, &ldquo;is of a breed
I know. I knew the cut of its jib whenever it was put
down. That was the grandmother of the cock that
frightened Peter.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I thought it was a historical animal,&rdquo;
says I. &ldquo;What a shame to kill it. It&rsquo;s as bad as eating
Whittington&rsquo;s cat or the Dog of Montargis.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Na&mdash;na,
it&rsquo;s no so old,&rdquo; says the landlady, &ldquo;but it eats hard.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Eats!&rdquo;
I cry, &ldquo;where do you find that? Very little
of that verb with us.&rdquo; So with more raillery, we pay six
shillings for our festival and run over to Earraid, shaking
the dust of the Argyll Hotel from off our feet.</p>

<p>I can write no more just now, and I hope you will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>30</span>
able to decipher so much; for it contains matter. Really,
the whole of yesterday&rsquo;s work would do in a novel without
one little bit of embellishment; and, indeed, few novels
are so amusing. Bough, Miss Amy, Mrs. Ross, Blackie,
M&mdash;&mdash; the parson&mdash;all these were such distinct characters,
the incidents were so entertaining, and the scenery so fine,
that the whole would have made a novelist&rsquo;s fortune.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MAUD</span>,&mdash;If you have forgotten the handwriting&mdash;as
is like enough&mdash;you will find the name of a former
correspondent (don&rsquo;t know how to spell that word) at
the end. I have begun to write to you before now, but
always stuck somehow, and left it to drown in a
drawerful of like fiascos. This time I am determined
to carry through, though I have nothing specially to
say.</p>

<p>We look fairly like summer this morning; the trees
are blackening out of their spring greens; the warmer
suns have melted the hoarfrost of daisies of the paddock;
and the blackbird, I fear, already beginning to &ldquo;stint his
pipe of mellower days&ldquo;&mdash;which is very apposite (I can&rsquo;t
spell anything to-day&mdash;<i>one</i> p or <i>two</i>?) and pretty. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>31</span>
the same, we have been having shocking weather&mdash;cold
winds and grey skies.</p>

<p>I have been reading heaps of nice books; but I can&rsquo;t
go back so far. I am reading Clarendon&rsquo;s <i>Hist. Rebell.</i>
at present, with which I am more pleased than I expected,
which is saying a good deal. It is a pet idea of mine that
one gets more real truth out of one avowed partisan than
out of a dozen of your sham impartialists&mdash;wolves in
sheep&rsquo;s clothing&mdash;simpering honesty as they suppress
documents. After all, what one wants to know is not
what people did, but why they did it&mdash;or rather, why
they <i>thought</i> they did it; and to learn that, you should
go to the men themselves. Their very falsehood is often
more than another man&rsquo;s truth.</p>

<p>I have possessed myself of Mrs. Hutchinson, which, of
course, I admire, etc. But is there not an irritating
deliberation and correctness about her and everybody
connected with her? If she would only write bad
grammar, or forget to finish a sentence, or do something
or other that looks fallible, it would be a relief. I sometimes
wish the old Colonel had got drunk and beaten
her, in the bitterness of my spirit. I know I felt a weight
taken off my heart when I heard he was extravagant. It
is quite possible to be too good for this evil world; and
unquestionably, Mrs. Hutchinson was. The way in which
she talks of herself makes one&rsquo;s blood run cold. There&mdash;I
am glad to have got that out&mdash;but don&rsquo;t say it to
anybody&mdash;seal of secrecy.</p>

<p>Please tell Mr. Babington that I have never forgotten
one of his drawings&mdash;a Rubens, I think&mdash;a woman holding
up a model ship. That woman had more life in her than
ninety per cent. of the lame humans that you see crippling
about this earth.</p>

<p>By the way, that is a feature in art which seems to
have come in with the Italians. Your old Greek statues
have scarce enough vitality in them to keep their monstrous
bodies fresh withal. A shrewd country attorney,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>32</span>
in a turned white neckcloth and rusty blacks, would just
take one of these Agamemnons and Ajaxes quietly by
his beautiful, strong arm, trot the unresisting statue down
a little gallery of legal shams, and turn the poor fellow
out at the other end, &ldquo;naked, as from the earth he came.&rdquo;
There is more latent life, more of the coiled spring in the
sleeping dog, about a recumbent figure of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s
than about the most excited of Greek statues. The very
marble seems to wrinkle with a wild energy that we never
feel except in dreams.</p>

<p>I think this letter has turned into a sermon, but I had
nothing interesting to talk about.</p>

<p>I do wish you and Mr. Babington would think better
of it and come north this summer. We should be so glad
to see you both. <i>Do</i> reconsider it.&mdash;Believe me, my dear

you; you know, you and I have so many old stories
between us, that even if there was nothing else, even if
there was not a very sincere respect and affection, we
should always be glad to pass a nod. I say, &ldquo;even if
there was not.&rdquo; But you know right well there is. Do
not suppose that I shall ever forget those long, bitter
nights, when I coughed and coughed and was so unhappy,
and you were so patient and loving with a poor, sick child.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>33</span>
Indeed, Cummy, I wish I might become a man worth
talking of, if it were only that you should not have thrown
away your pains.</p>

<p>Happily, it is not the result of our acts that makes
them brave and noble, but the acts themselves and the
unselfish love that moved us to do them. &ldquo;Inasmuch as
you have done it unto one of the least of these.&rdquo; My
dear old nurse, and you know there is nothing a man can
say nearer his heart except his mother or his wife&mdash;my
dear old nurse, God will make good to you all the good
that you have done, and mercifully forgive you all the
evil. And next time when the spring comes round, and
everything is beginning once again, if you should happen
to think that you might have had a child of your own,
and that it was hard you should have spent so many
years taking care of some one else&rsquo;s prodigal, just you
think this&mdash;you have been for a great deal in my life;
you have made much that there is in me, just as surely
as if you had conceived me; and there are sons who are
more ungrateful to their own mothers than I am to you.
For I am not ungrateful, my dear Cummy, and it is with
a very sincere emotion that I write myself your little boy,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BAXTER</span>,&mdash;By the date you may perhaps
understand the purport of my letter without any words
wasted about the matter. I cannot walk with you to-morrow,
and you must not expect me. I came yesterday
afternoon to Bridge of Allan, and have been very happy
ever since, as every place is sanctified by the eighth sense,
Memory. I walked up here this morning (three miles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>34</span>
<i>tu-dieu!</i> a good stretch for me), and passed one of my
favourite places in the world, and one that I very much
affect in spirit when the body is tied down and brought
immovably to anchor on a sickbed. It is a meadow and
bank on a corner on the river, and is connected in my
mind inseparably with Virgil&rsquo;s <i>Eclogues. Hic corulis
mistos inter consedimus ulmos</i>, or something very like
that, the passage begins (only I know my short-winded
Latinity must have come to grief over even this much
of quotation); and here, to a wish, is just such a cavern
as Menalcas might shelter himself withal from the bright
noon, and, with his lips curled backward, pipe himself
blue in the face, while <i>Messieurs les Arcadiens</i> would roll
out those cloying hexameters that sing themselves in
one&rsquo;s mouth to such a curious lilting chant.</p>

<p>In such weather one has the bird&rsquo;s need to whistle;
and I, who am specially incompetent in this art, must
content myself by chattering away to you on this bit of
paper. All the way along I was thanking God that he
had made me and the birds and everything just as they
are and not otherwise; for although there was no sun,
the air was so thrilled with robins and blackbirds that it
made the heart tremble with joy, and the leaves are far
enough forward on the underwood to give a fine promise
for the future. Even myself, as I say, I would not have
had changed in one <i>iota</i> this forenoon, in spite of all my
idleness and Guthrie&rsquo;s lost paper, which is ever present
with me&mdash;a horrible phantom.</p>

<p>No one can be alone at home or in a quite new place.
Memory and you must go hand in hand with (at least)
decent weather if you wish to cook up a proper dish of
solitude. It is in these little flights of mine that I get
more pleasure than in anything else. Now, at present, I
am supremely uneasy and restless&mdash;almost to the extent

as desirable.</p>

I know nothing about the Standing Committee of the

such &ldquo;goodly fellowship.&rdquo; I am a &ldquo;Rural Voluptuary&rdquo;

<p>In the previous year, 1871, it had become apparent that Stevenson
was neither fitted by bodily health nor by inclination for the
family profession of civil engineer. Accordingly his summer excursions
were no longer to the harbour works and lighthouses of
Scotland, but to the ordinary scenes of holiday travel abroad.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Brussels, Thursday, 25th July 1872.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;I am here at last, sitting in my
room, without coat or waistcoat, and with both window
and door open, and yet perspiring like a terra-cotta jug
or a Gruyère cheese.</p>

<p>We had a very good passage, which we certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>37</span>
deserved, in compensation for having to sleep on the
cabin floor, and finding absolutely nothing fit for human
food in the whole filthy embarkation. We made up for
lost time by sleeping on deck a good part of the forenoon.
When I woke, Simpson was still sleeping the sleep of the
just, on a coil of ropes and (as appeared afterwards) his
own hat; so I got a bottle of Bass and a pipe and laid
hold of an old Frenchman of somewhat filthy aspect (<i>fiat
experimentum in corpore vili</i>) to try my French upon.
I made very heavy weather of it. The Frenchman had
a very pretty young wife; but my French always deserted
me entirely when I had to answer her, and so she soon
drew away and left me to her lord, who talked of French
politics, Africa, and domestic economy with great vivacity.
From Ostend a smoking-hot journey to Brussels. At
Brussels we went off after dinner to the Parc. If any
person wants to be happy, I should advise the Parc.
You sit drinking iced drinks and smoking penny cigars
under great old trees. The band place, covered walks,
etc., are all lit up. And you can&rsquo;t fancy how beautiful
was the contrast of the great masses of lamplit foliage
and the dark sapphire night sky with just one blue star
set overhead in the middle of the largest patch. In the
dark walks, too, there are crowds of people whose faces
you cannot see, and here and there a colossal white statue
at the corner of an alley that gives the place a nice, <i>artificial</i>,
eighteenth century sentiment. There was a good deal of
summer lightning blinking overhead, and the black avenues
and white statues leapt out every minute into short-lived
distinctness.</p>

<p>I get up to add one thing more. There is in the hotel
a boy in whom I take the deepest interest. I cannot
tell you his age, but the very first time I saw him (when
I was at dinner yesterday) I was very much struck with
his appearance. There is something very leonine in his
face, with a dash of the negro especially, if I remember
aright, in the mouth. He has a great quantity of dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>38</span>
hair, curling in great rolls, not in little corkscrews, and
a pair of large, dark, and very steady, bold, bright eyes.
His manners are those of a prince. I felt like an overgrown
ploughboy beside him. He speaks English perfectly,
but with, I think, sufficient foreign accent to stamp
him as a Russian, especially when his manners are taken
into account. I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw any one who looked
like a hero before. After breakfast this morning I was
talking to him in the court, when he mentioned casually
that he had caught a snake in the Riesengebirge. &ldquo;I
have it here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;would you like to see it?&rdquo; I
said yes; and putting his hand into his breast-pocket, he
drew forth not a dried serpent skin, but the head and
neck of the reptile writhing and shooting out its horrible
tongue in my face. You may conceive what a fright I
got. I send off this single sheet just now in order to let
you know I am safe across; but you must not expect
letters often.</p>

<p><span class="sc">... Last</span> night I met with rather an amusing adventurette.
Seeing a church door open, I went in, and was
led by most importunate finger-bills up a long stair to
the top of the tower. The father smoking at the door,
the mother and the three daughters received me as if I
was a friend of the family and had come in for an evening
visit. The youngest daughter (about thirteen, I suppose,
and a pretty little girl) had been learning English at the
school, and was anxious to play it off upon a real, veritable
Englander; so we had a long talk, and I was shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>39</span>
photographs, etc., Marie and I talking, and the others
looking on with evident delight at having such a linguist
in the family. As all my remarks were duly translated
and communicated to the rest, it was quite a good German
lesson. There was only one contretemps during the
whole interview&mdash;the arrival of another visitor, in the
shape (surely) the last of God&rsquo;s creatures, a wood-worm
of the most unnatural and hideous appearance, with one
great striped horn sticking out of his nose like a boltsprit.
If there are many wood-worms in Germany, I shall come
home. The most courageous men in the world must be
entomologists. I had rather be a lion-tamer.</p>

<p>To-day I got rather a curiosity&mdash;<i>Lieder und Balladen
von Robert Burns</i>, translated by one Silbergleit, and not
so ill done either. Armed with which, I had a swim in
the Main, and then bread and cheese and Bavarian beer
in a sort of café, or at least the German substitute for
a café; but what a falling off after the heavenly forenoons
in Brussels!</p>

<p>I have bought a meerschaum out of local sentiment,
and am now very low and nervous about the bargain,
having paid dearer than I should in England, and got
a worse article, if I can form a judgment.</p>

I shall go into lodgings, as this hotel work makes the
money disappear like butter in a furnace.&mdash;Meanwhile

<p class="rt"><i>Hotel Landsberg, Thursday, 1st August 1872.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">... Yesterday</span> I walked to Eckenheim, a village a
little way out of Frankfurt, and turned into the alehouse.
In the room, which was just such as it would have been
in Scotland, were the landlady, two neighbours, and an
old peasant eating raw sausage at the far end. I soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>40</span>
got into conversation; and was astonished when the
landlady, having asked whether I were an Englishman,
and received an answer in the affirmative, proceeded to
inquire further whether I were not also a Scotchman.
It turned out that a Scotch doctor&mdash;a professor&mdash;a poet&mdash;who
wrote books&mdash;<i>gross wie das</i>&mdash;had come nearly every
day out of Frankfurt to the <i>Eckenheimer Wirthschaft</i>, and
had left behind him a most savoury memory in the hearts
of all its customers. One man ran out to find his name
for me, and returned with the news that it was <i>Cobie</i>
(Scobie, I suspect); and during his absence the rest were
pouring into my ears the fame and acquirements of my
countryman. He was, in some undecipherable manner,
connected with the Queen of England and one of the
Princesses. He had been in Turkey, and had there married
a wife of immense wealth. They could find apparently
no measure adequate to express the size of his books.
In one way or another, he had amassed a princely fortune,
and had apparently only one sorrow, his daughter to
wit, who had absconded into a <i>Kloster</i>, with a considerable
slice of the mother&rsquo;s <i>Geld</i>. I told them we had no
Klosters in Scotland, with a certain feeling of superiority.
No more had they, I was told&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Hier ist unser Kloster!</i>&rdquo;
and the speaker motioned with both arms round the
taproom. Although the first torrent was exhausted, yet
the Doctor came up again in all sorts of ways, and with
or without occasion, throughout the whole interview; as,
for example, when one man, taking his pipe out of his
mouth and shaking his head, remarked <i>àpropos</i> of nothing
and with almost defiant conviction, &ldquo;<i>Er war ein feiner
Mann, der Herr Doctor</i>,&rdquo; and was answered by another
with &ldquo;<i>Yaw, yaw, und trank immer rothen Wein</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Setting aside the Doctor, who had evidently turned the
brains of the entire village, they were intelligent people.
One thing in particular struck me, their honesty in admitting
that here they spoke bad German, and advising me
to go to Coburg or Leipsic for German.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Sie sprechen da</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>41</span>
<i>rein</i>&rdquo; (clean), said one; and they all nodded their heads
together like as many mandarins, and repeated <i>rein, so
rein</i> in chorus.</p>

<p>Of course we got upon Scotland. The hostess said,
&ldquo;<i>Die Schottländer trinken gern Schnapps</i>,&rdquo; which may be
freely translated, &ldquo;Scotchmen are horrid fond of whisky.&rdquo;
It was impossible, of course, to combat such a truism;
and so I proceeded to explain the construction of toddy,
interrupted by a cry of horror when I mentioned the
<i>hot</i> water; and thence, as I find is always the case, to
the most ghastly romancing about Scottish scenery and
manners, the Highland dress, and everything national or
local that I could lay my hands upon. Now that I have
got my German Burns, I lean a good deal upon him for
opening a conversation, and read a few translations to
every yawning audience that I can gather. I am grown
most insufferably national, you see. I fancy it is a punishment
for my want of it at ordinary times. Now, what
do you think, there was a waiter in this very hotel, but,
alas! he is now gone, who sang (from morning to night,
as my informant said with a shrug at the recollection)
what but <i>&rsquo;s ist lange her</i>, the German version of Auld Lang
Syne; so you see, madame, the finest lyric ever written
<i>will</i> make its way out of whatsoever corner of patois it
found its birth in.</p>

<p>There is one thing that burthens me a good deal in my

which I grope about everything, as, for example, when
I gave yesterday a full and, I fancy, a startlingly incorrect
account of Scotch education to a very stolid German
on a garden bench: he sat and perspired under it, however,
with much composure. I am generally glad enough

Burns, toddy, and the Highlands.</p>

<p><i>Friday, August 2, 1872.</i>&mdash;In the evening, at the theatre,
I had a great laugh. Lord Allcash in <i>Fra Diavolo</i>, with
his white hat, red guide-books, and bad German, was the

<p class="rt"><i>Frankfurt, Rosengasse 13, August 4, 1872.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;You will perceive by the head
of this page that we have at last got into lodgings, and
powerfully mean ones too. If I were to call the street
anything but <i>shady</i>, I should be boasting. The people
sit at their doors in shirt-sleeves, smoking as they do in
Seven Dials of a Sunday.</p>

<p>Last night we went to bed about ten, for the first time
<i>householders</i> in Germany&mdash;real Teutons, with no deception,
spring, or false bottom. About half-past one there began
such a trumpeting, shouting, pealing of bells, and scurrying
hither and thither of feet as woke every person in
Frankfurt out of their first sleep with a vague sort of
apprehension that the last day was at hand. The whole
street was alive, and we could hear people talking in
their rooms, or crying to passers-by from their windows,
all around us. At last I made out what a man was saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>43</span>
in the next room. It was a fire in Sachsenhausen, he
said (Sachsenhausen is the suburb on the other side of
the Main), and he wound up with one of the most tremendous
falsehoods on record, &ldquo;<i>Hier alles ruht</i>&mdash;here all is
still.&rdquo; If it can be said to be still in an engine factory,
or in the stomach of a volcano when it is meditating an
eruption, he might have been justified in what he said,
but not otherwise. The tumult continued unabated for
near an hour; but as one grew used to it, it gradually
resolved itself into three bells, answering each other at
short intervals across the town, a man shouting at ever
shorter intervals and with superhuman energy, &rdquo;<i>Feuer&mdash;im
Sachsenhausen</i>,&rdquo; and the almost continuous winding of
all manner of bugles and trumpets, sometimes in stirring
flourishes, and sometimes in mere tuneless wails. Occasionally
there was another rush of feet past the window,
and once there was a mighty drumming, down between
us and the river, as though the soldiery were turning out
to keep the peace. This was all we had of the fire, except
a great cloud, all flushed red with the glare, above the
roofs on the other side of the Gasse; but it was quite
enough to put me entirely off my sleep and make me
keenly alive to three or four gentlemen who were strolling
leisurely about my person, and every here and there
leaving me somewhat as a keepsake.... However,
everything has its compensation, and when day came at
last, and the sparrows awoke with trills and <i>carol-ets</i>, the
dawn seemed to fall on me like a sleeping draught. I
went to the window and saw the sparrows about the eaves,
and a great troop of doves go strolling up the paven Gasse,
seeking what they may devour. And so to sleep, despite
fleas and fire-alarms, and clocks chiming the hours out
of neighbouring houses at all sorts of odd times and with
the most charming want of unanimity.</p>

<p>We have got settled down in Frankfurt, and like the
place very much. Simpson and I seem to get on very
well together. We suit each other capitally; and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>44</span>
an awful joke to be living (two would-be advocates, and
one a baronet) in this supremely mean abode.</p>

<p>The abode is, however, a great improvement on the
hotel, and I think we shall grow quite fond of it.&mdash;Ever

<p class="rt"><i>13 Rosengasse, Frankfurt,
Tuesday Morning, August 1872.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">... Last</span> night I was at the theatre and heard <i>Die
Judin</i> (<i>La Juive</i>), and was thereby terribly excited. At
last, in the middle of the fifth act, which was perfectly
beastly, I had to slope. I could stand even seeing the
cauldron with the sham fire beneath, and the two hateful
executioners in red; but when at last the girl&rsquo;s courage
breaks down, and, grasping her father&rsquo;s arm, she cries
out&mdash;O so shudderfully!&mdash;I thought it high time to be
out of that <i>galère</i>, and so I do not know yet whether it
ends well or ill; but if I ever afterwards find that they
do carry things to the extremity, I shall think more meanly
of my species. It was raining and cold outside, so I went
into a <i>Bierhalle</i>, and sat and brooded over a <i>Schnitt</i> (half-glass)
for nearly an hour. An opera is far more <i>real</i> than
real life to me. It seems as if stage illusion, and particularly
this hardest to swallow and most conventional illusion
of them all&mdash;an opera&mdash;would never stale upon me.
I wish that life was an opera. I should like to <i>live</i> in
one; but I don&rsquo;t know in what quarter of the globe I shall
find a society so constituted. Besides, it would soon
pall: imagine asking for three-kreuzer cigars in recitative,
or giving the washerwoman the inventory of your dirty
clothes in a sustained and <i>flourishous</i> aria.</p>

<p>I am in a right good mood this morning to sit here
and write to you; but not to give you news. There is a
great stir of life, in a quiet, almost country fashion, all
about us here. Some one is hammering a beef-steak in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>45</span>
<i>rez-de-chaussée</i>: there is a great clink of pitchers and noise of
the pump-handle at the public well in the little square-kin
round the corner. The children, all seemingly within a
month, and certainly none above five, that always go halting
and stumbling up and down the roadway, are ordinarily
very quiet, and sit sedately puddling in the gutter, trying,
I suppose, poor little devils! to understand their <i>Muttersprache;</i>
but they, too, make themselves heard from time
to time in little incomprehensible antiphonies, about the drift
that comes down to them by their rivers from the strange
lands higher up the Gasse. Above all, there is here such a
twittering of canaries (I can see twelve out of our window),
and such continual visitation of grey doves and big-nosed
sparrows, as make our little bye-street into a perfect aviary.</p>

<p>I look across the Gasse at our opposite neighbour, as
he dandles his baby about, and occasionally takes a
spoonful or two of some pale slimy nastiness that looks
like <i>dead porridge</i>, if you can take the conception. These
two are his only occupations. All day long you can hear
him singing over the brat when he is not eating; or see
him eating when he is not keeping baby. Besides which,
there comes into his house a continual round of visitors
that puts me in mind of the luncheon hour at home. As
he has thus no ostensible avocation, we have named him
&ldquo;the W.S.&rdquo; to give a flavour of respectability to the street.</p>

<p>Enough of the Gasse. The weather is here much
colder. It rained a good deal yesterday; and though
it is fair and sunshiny again to-day, and we can still sit,
of course, with our windows open, yet there is no more
excuse for the siesta; and the bathe in the river, except
for cleanliness, is no longer a necessity of life. The Main
is very swift. In one part of the baths it is next door
to impossible to swim against it, and I suspect that, out
in the open, it would be quite impossible.&mdash;Adieu, my
dear mother, and believe me, ever your affectionate

<p>So; <i>en voilà assez de mauvais vers.</i> Let us finish with
a word or two in honest prose, tho&rsquo; indeed I shall so soon
be back again and, if you be in town as I hope, so soon
get linked again down the Lothian road by a cigar or two
and a liquor, that it is perhaps scarce worth the postage
to send my letter on before me. I have just been long
enough away to be satisfied and even anxious to get home
again and talk the matter over with my friends. I shall
have plenty to tell you; and principally plenty that I
do not care to write; and I daresay, you, too, will have
a lot of gossip. What about Ferrier? Is the L.J.R.
think you to go naked and unashamed this winter? He
with his charming idiosyncrasy was in my eyes the vine-leaf
that preserved our self-respect. All the rest of us
are such shadows, compared to his full-flavoured personality;
but I must not spoil my own <i>début</i>. I am trenching
upon one of the essayettes which I propose to introduce
as a novelty this year before that august assembly.
For we must not let it die. It is a sickly baby, but what
with nursing, and pap, and the like, I do not see why
it should not have a stout manhood after all, and perhaps
a green old age. Eh! when we are old (if we ever should
be) that too will be one of those cherished memories I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>49</span>
have been so rhapsodizing over. We must consecrate
our room. We must make it a museum of bright recollections;
so that we may go back there white-headed, and
say &ldquo;Vixi.&rdquo; After all, new countries, sun, music, and all
the rest can never take down our gusty, rainy, smoky,
grim old city out of the first place that it has been making
for itself in the bottom of my soul, by all pleasant and
hard things that have befallen me for these past twenty
years or so. My heart is buried there&mdash;say, in Advocate&rsquo;s
Close!</p>

<p>Simpson and I got on very well together, and made
a very suitable pair. I like him much better than I did
when I started which was almost more than I hoped for.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, October 1872.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BAXTER</span>,&mdash;I am gum-boiled and face swollen
to an unprecedented degree. It is very depressing to
suffer from gibber that cannot be brought to a head. I
cannot speak it, because my face is so swollen and stiff
that enunciation must be deliberate&mdash;a thing your true
gibberer cannot hold up his head under; and writ gibber
is somehow not gibber at all, it does not come forth, does
not <i>flow</i>, with that fine irrational freedom that it loves
in speech&mdash;it does not afford relief to the packed bosom.</p>

<p>Hence I am suffering from <i>suppressed gibber</i>&mdash;an uneasy
complaint; and like all cases of suppressed humours,
this hath a nasty tendency to the brain. Therefore (the
more confused I get, the more I lean on Thus&rsquo;s and Hences
and Therefores) you must not be down upon me, most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>50</span>
noble Festus, altho&rsquo; this letter should smack of some
infirmity of judgment. I speak the words of soberness
and truth; and would you were not almost but altogether
as I am, except this swelling. Lord, Lord, if we could
change personalities how we should hate it. How I should
rebel at the office, repugn under the Ulster coat, and
repudiate your monkish humours thus unjustly and
suddenly thrust upon poor, infidel me! And as for you&mdash;why,
my dear Charles, &ldquo;a mouse that hath its lodging
in a cat&rsquo;s ear&rdquo; would not be so uneasy as you in your
new conditions. I do not see how your temperament
would come thro&rsquo; the feverish longings to do things that
cannot then (or perhaps ever) be accomplished, the feverish
unrests and damnable indecisions, that it takes all my
easy-going spirits to come through. A vane can live out
anything in the shape of a wind; and that is how I can
be, and am, a more serious person than you. Just as
the light French seemed very serious to Sterne, light
L. Stevenson can afford to bob about over the top of any
deep sea of prospect or retrospect, where ironclad C. Baxter
would incontinently go down with all hands. A fool is
generally the wisest person out. The wise man must
shut his eyes to all the perils and horrors that lie round
him; but the cap and bells can go bobbing along the
most slippery ledges and the bauble will not stir up
sleeping lions. Hurray! for motley, for a good sound
<i>insouciance</i>, for a healthy philosophic carelessness!</p>

<p>My dear Baxter, a word in your ear&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="sc">DON&rsquo;T YOU
WISH YOU WERE A FOOL</span>?&rdquo; How easy the world would
go on with you&mdash;literally on castors. The only reason a
wise man can assign for getting drunk is that he wishes
to enjoy for a while the blessed immunities and sunshiny
weather of the land of fooldom. But a fool, who dwells
ever there, has no excuse at all. <i>That</i> is a happy land,
if you like&mdash;and not so far away either. Take a fool&rsquo;s
advice and let us strive without ceasing to get into it.
Hark in your ear again: &ldquo;<span class="sc">THEY ALLOW PEOPLE TO REASON</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>51</span>
<span class="sc">IN THAT LAND</span>.&rdquo; I wish I could take you by the hand
and lead you away into its pleasant boundaries. There
is no custom-house on the frontier, and you may take
in what books you will. There are no manners and customs;
but men and women grow up, like trees in a still,
well-walled garden, &ldquo;at their own sweet will.&rdquo; There is
no prescribed or customary folly&mdash;no motley, cap, or
bauble: out of the well of each one&rsquo;s own innate absurdity
he is allowed and encouraged freely to draw and to communicate;
and it is a strange thing how this natural
fooling comes so nigh to one&rsquo;s better thoughts of wisdom;
and stranger still, that all this discord of people speaking
in their own natural moods and keys, masses itself into
a far more perfect harmony than all the dismal, official
unison in which they sing in other countries. Part-singing
seems best all the world over.</p>

<p>I who live in England must wear the hackneyed symbols
of the profession, to show that I have (at least) consular
immunities, coming as I do out of another land,
where they are not so wise as they are here, but fancy
that God likes what he makes and is not best pleased
with us when we deface and dissemble all that he has
given us and put about us to one common standard of&mdash;&mdash;Highty-Tighty!&mdash;when
was a jester obliged to finish his
sentence? I cut so strong a pirouette that all my bells
jingle, and come down in an attitude, with one hand
upon my hip. The evening&rsquo;s entertainment is over,&mdash;&ldquo;and
if our kyind friends&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;</p>

<p>Hurrah! I feel relieved. I have put out my gibber,
and if you have read thus far, you will have taken it in.
I wonder if you will ever come this length. I shall try
a trap for you, and insult you here, on this last page. &ldquo;O
Baxter what a damned humbug you are!&rdquo; There,&mdash;shall
this insult bloom and die unseen, or will you come toward
me, when next we meet, with a face deformed with anger
and demand speedy and bloody satisfaction. <i>Nous verrons</i>,

<p>In the winter of 1872-73 Stevenson was out of health again;

the next twelve months clouded his home life. The following
shows exactly in what spirit he took it:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh,
Sunday, February 2, 1873.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BAXTER</span>,&mdash;The thunderbolt has fallen with a
vengeance now. On Friday night after leaving you, in
the course of conversation, my father put me one or two
questions as to beliefs, which I candidly answered. I
really hate all lying so much now&mdash;a new found honesty
that has somehow come out of my late illness&mdash;that I
could not so much as hesitate at the time; but if I had
foreseen the real hell of everything since, I think I should
have lied, as I have done so often before. I so far thought
of my father, but I had forgotten my mother. And now!
they are both ill, both silent, both as down in the mouth
as if&mdash;I can find no simile. You may fancy how happy it
is for me. If it were not too late, I think I could almost
find it in my heart to retract, but it is too late; and
again, am I to live my whole life as one falsehood? Of
course, it is rougher than hell upon my father, but can
I help it? They don&rsquo;t see either that my game is not
the light-hearted scoffer; that I am not (as they call me)
a careless infidel. I believe as much as they do, only
generally in the inverse ratio: I am, I think, as honest
as they can be in what I hold. I have not come hastily
to my views. I reserve (as I told them) many points
until I acquire fuller information, and do not think I
am thus justly to be called &ldquo;horrible atheist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, what is to take place? What a curse I am to
my parents! O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is to
have just <i>damned</i> the happiness of (probably) the only
two people who care a damn about you in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>53</span></p>

<p>What is my life to be at this rate? What, you rascal?
Answer&mdash;I have a pistol at your throat. If all that I
hold true and most desire to spread is to be such death,
and worse than death, in the eyes of my father and mother,
what the <i>devil</i> am I to do?</p>

<p>Here is a good heavy cross with a vengeance, and all
rough with rusty nails that tear your fingers, only it is
not I that have to carry it alone; I hold the light end,
but the heavy burden falls on these two.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I was going to say. I
am an abject idiot, which, all things considered, is not
remarkable.&mdash;Ever your affectionate and horrible atheist,</p>

<h3>STUDENT DAYS&mdash;<i>Continued</i></h3>

<h5>NEW FRIENDSHIPS&mdash;ORDERED SOUTH</h5>

<h6><span class="sc">July 1873-May 1874</span></h6>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> year 1873 was a critical one in Stevenson&rsquo;s life.
Late in July he went for the second time to pay a visit
to Cockfield Rectory, the pleasant Suffolk home of his
cousin Mrs. Churchill Babington and her husband. Another
guest at the same time was Mrs. Sitwell&mdash;now my wife&mdash;an
intimate friend and connection by marriage of the
hostess. I was shortly due to join the party, when Mrs.
Sitwell wrote telling me of the &ldquo;fine young spirit&rdquo; she
had found under her friend&rsquo;s roof, and suggesting that
I should hasten my visit so as to make his acquaintance
before he left. I came accordingly, and from that time
on the fine young spirit became a leading interest both
in her life and mine. He had thrown himself on her
sympathies, in that troubled hour of his youth, with
entire dependence almost from the first, and clung to her
devotedly for the next two years as to an inspirer, consoler,
and guide. Under her influence he began for the first
time to see his way in life, and to believe hopefully and
manfully in his own powers and future. To encourage
such hopes further, and to lend what hand one could
towards their fulfilment, became quickly one of the first
of cares and pleasures. It was impossible not to recognise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>55</span>
in this very un-academical type of Scottish youth, a
spirit the most interesting and full of promise. His
social charm was already at its height, and quite irresistible;
but inwardly he was full of trouble and self-doubt.
If he could steer himself or be steered safely
through the difficulties of youth, and if he could learn
to write with half the charm and genius that shone from
his presence and conversation, there seemed room to hope
for the highest from him. He went back to Edinburgh
in the beginning of September full of new hope and heart.
It had been agreed that while still reading, as his parents
desired, for the bar, he should try seriously to get ready
for publication some essays which he had already on
hand&mdash;one on Walt Whitman, one on John Knox, one
on Roads and the Spirit of the Road&mdash;and should so
far as possible avoid topics of dispute in the home circle.</p>

<p>But after a while the news of him was not favourable.
Those differences with his father, which had been
weighing almost morbidly upon his high-strung nature,
were renewed. By mid-October his letters told of failing
health. He came to London, and instead of presenting
himself, as had been proposed, to be examined for admission
to one of the London Inns of Court, he was forced to
consult the late Sir Andrew Clark, who found him suffering
from acute nerve exhaustion, with some threat of
danger to the lungs. He was ordered to break at once
with Edinburgh for a time, and to spend the winter in
a more soothing climate and surroundings. He went
accordingly to Mentone, a place he had delighted in as
a boy ten years before, and during a stay of six months
made a slow, but for the time being a pretty complete,
recovery. I visited him twice during the winter, and
the second time found him coming fairly to himself again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>56</span>
in the southern peace and sunshine. He was busy with
the essay <i>Ordered South</i>, and with that on <i>Victor Hugo&rsquo;s
Romances</i>, which was afterwards his first contribution to
the Cornhill Magazine; was full of a thousand dreams
and projects for future work; and was passing his invalid
days pleasantly meanwhile in the companionship of two
kind and accomplished Russian ladies, who took to him
warmly, and of their children. The following record of
the time is drawn from his correspondence partly with
his parents and partly with myself, but chiefly from the
journal-letters, containing a full and intimate record of
his daily moods and doings, which he was accustomed to
send off weekly or oftener to Mrs. Sitwell.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;I am too happy to be much of
a correspondent. Yesterday we were away to Melford
and Lavenham, both exceptionally placid, beautiful old
English towns. Melford scattered all round a big green,
with an Elizabethan Hall and Park, great screens of trees
that seem twice as high as trees should seem, and everything
else like what ought to be in a novel, and what one
never expects to see in reality, made me cry out how
good we were to live in Scotland, for the many hundredth
time. I cannot get over my astonishment&mdash;indeed, it
increases every day&mdash;at the hopeless gulf that there is
between England and Scotland, and English and Scotch.
Nothing is the same; and I feel as strange and outlandish
here as I do in France or Germany. Everything by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>57</span>
the wayside, in the houses, or about the people, strikes
me with an unexpected unfamiliarity: I walk among surprises,
for just where you think you have them, something
wrong turns up.</p>

<p>I got a little Law read yesterday, and some German
this morning, but on the whole there are too many amusements
going for much work; as for correspondence, I
have neither heart nor time for it to-day.</p>

<p>After leaving Cockfield Stevenson spent a few days in London
and a few with me in a cottage I then had at Norwood. This and
the following letters were written in the next days after his return
home. &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; in the last paragraph is Robert Alan Mowbray
Stevenson, an elder cousin to whom Louis had been from boyhood

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> arrived, as you see, without accident; but I
never had a more wretched journey in my life. I could
not settle to read anything; I bought Darwin&rsquo;s last book
in despair, for I knew I could generally read Darwin, but
it was a failure. However, the book served me in good
stead; for when a couple of children got in at Newcastle,
I struck up a great friendship with them on the strength
of the illustrations. These two children (a girl of nine
and a boy of six) had never before travelled in a railway,
so that everything was a glory to them, and they
were never tired of watching the telegraph posts and trees
and hedges go racing past us to the tail of the train;
and the girl I found quite entered into the most daring
personifications that I could make. A little way on,
about Alnmouth, they had their first sight of the sea;
and it was wonderful how loath they were to believe that
what they saw was water; indeed it was very still and
grey and solid-looking under a sky to match. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>58</span>
worth the fare, yet a little farther on, to see the delight
of the girl when she passed into &ldquo;another country,&rdquo; with
the black Tweed under our feet, crossed by the lamps of
the passenger bridge. I remember the first time I had
gone into &ldquo;another country,&rdquo; over the same river from
the other side.</p>

<p>Bob was not at the station when I arrived; but a
friend of his brought me a letter; and he is to be in the

life? I would not have missed last month for eternity.&mdash;Ever

<p>The paper on <i>Roads</i> herein mentioned had been planned during
walks at Cockfield; was offered to and rejected by the Saturday

to periodical literature.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh</i>,
<i>Saturday, September 6, 1873.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> been to-day a very long walk with my father
through some of the most beautiful ways hereabouts;
the day was cold with an iron, windy sky, and only
glorified now and then with autumn sunlight. For it is
fully autumn with us, with a blight already over the
greens, and a keen wind in the morning that makes
one rather timid of one&rsquo;s tub when it finds its way
indoors.</p>

<p>I was out this evening to call on a friend, and, coming
back through the wet, crowded, lamp-lit streets, was
singing after my own fashion, &ldquo;<i>Du hast Diamanten und
Perlen</i>,&rdquo; when I heard a poor cripple man in the gutter
wailing over a pitiful Scotch air, his club-foot supported
on the other knee, and his whole woebegone body propped
sideways against a crutch. The nearest lamp threw a
strong light on his worn, sordid face and the three boxes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>59</span>
of lucifer matches that he held for sale. My own false
notes stuck in my chest. How well off I am! is the
burthen of my songs all day long&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Drum ist so wohl
mir in der Welt!</i>&rdquo; and the ugly reality of the cripple
man was an intrusion on the beautiful world in which
I was walking. He could no more sing than I could;
and his voice was cracked and rusty, and altogether
perished. To think that that wreck may have walked
the streets some night years ago, as glad at heart as I
was, and promising himself a future as golden and
honourable!</p>

<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 11.20 <i>a.m.</i>&mdash;I wonder what you are doing
now?&mdash;in church likely, at the <i>Te Deum</i>. Everything
here is utterly silent. I can hear men&rsquo;s footfalls streets
away; the whole life of Edinburgh has been sucked into
sundry pious edifices; the gardens below my windows are
steeped in a diffused sunlight, and every tree seems standing
on tiptoes, strained and silent, as though to get its
head above its neighbour&rsquo;s and <i>listen</i>. You know what
I mean, don&rsquo;t you? How trees do seem silently to
assert themselves on an occasion! I have been trying
to write <i>Roads</i> until I feel as if I were standing on my
head; but I mean <i>Roads</i>, and shall do something to
them.</p>

<p>I wish I could make you feel the hush that is over
everything, only made the more perfect by rare interruptions;
and the rich, placid light, and the still autumnal
foliage. Houses, you know, stand all about our gardens:
solid, steady blocks of houses; all look empty and
asleep.</p>

<p><i>Monday night.</i>&mdash;The drums and fifes up in the castle
are sounding the guard-call through the dark, and there
is a great rattle of carriages without. I have had (I must
tell you) my bed taken out of this room, so that I am alone
in it with my books and two tables, and two chairs, and
a coal-skuttle (or <i>scuttle</i>) (?) and a <i>débris</i> of broken pipes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>60</span>
in a corner, and my old school play-box, so full of papers
and books that the lid will not shut down, standing
reproachfully in the midst. There is something in it that
is still a little gaunt and vacant; it needs a little populous
disorder over it to give it the feel of homeliness, and perhaps
a bit more furniture, just to take the edge off the
sense of illimitable space, eternity, and a future state,
and the like, that is brought home to one, even in this
small attic, by the wide, empty floor.</p>

<p>You would require to know, what only I can ever
know, many grim and many maudlin passages out of my
past life to feel how great a change has been made
for me by this past summer. Let me be ever so
poor and thread-paper a soul, I am going to try for the
best.</p>

<p>These good booksellers of mine have at last got a
<i>Werther</i> without illustrations. I want you to like Charlotte.
Werther himself has every feebleness and vice that
could tend to make his suicide a most virtuous and commendable
action; and yet I like Werther too&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know why, except that he has written the most delightful
letters in the world. Note, by the way, the passage under
date June 21st not far from the beginning; it finds a
voice for a great deal of dumb, uneasy, pleasurable longing
that we have all had, times without number. I looked
that up the other day for <i>Roads</i>, so I know the reference;
but you will find it a garden of flowers from beginning
to end. All through the passion keeps steadily rising,
from the thunderstorm at the country-house&mdash;there was
thunder in that story too&mdash;up to the last wild delirious
interview; either Lotte was no good at all, or else Werther
should have remained alive after that; either he knew
his woman too well, or else he was precipitate. But an
idiot like that is hopeless; and yet, he wasn&rsquo;t an idiot&mdash;I
make reparation, and will offer eighteen pounds of best
wax at his tomb. Poor devil! he was only the weakest&mdash;or,
at least, a very weak strong man.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh,
Friday, September 12, 1873.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">... I was</span> over last night, contrary to my own wish,
in Leven, Fife; and this morning I had a conversation
of which, I think, some account might interest you. I
was up with a cousin who was fishing in a mill-lade, and
a shower of rain drove me for shelter into a tumble-down
steading attached to the mill. There I found a labourer
cleaning a byre, with whom I fell into talk. The man
was to all appearance as heavy, as <i>hébété</i>, as any English
clodhopper; but I knew I was in Scotland, and launched
out forthright into Education and Politics and the aims
of one&rsquo;s life. I told him how I had found the peasantry
in Suffolk, and added that their state had made me feel
quite pained and down-hearted. &ldquo;It but to do that,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;to onybody that thinks at a&rsquo;!&rdquo; Then, again,
he said that he could not conceive how anything could
daunt or cast down a man who had an aim in life. &ldquo;They
that have had a guid schoolin&rsquo; and do nae mair, whatever
they do, they have done; but him that has aye something
ayont need never be weary.&rdquo; I have had to mutilate
the dialect much, so that it might be comprehensible to
you; but I think the sentiment will keep, even through
a change of words, something of the heartsome ring of
encouragement that it had for me: and that from a man
cleaning a byre! You see what John Knox and his schools
have done.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;This has been a charming day for me from
morning to now (5 <span class="sc">p.m</span>.). First, I found your letter, and
went down and read it on a seat in those Public Gardens
of which you have heard already. After lunch, my father
and I went down to the coast and walked a little way
along the shore between Granton and Cramond. This
has always been with me a very favourite walk. The Firth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>62</span>
closes gradually together before you, the coast runs in a
series of the most beautifully moulded bays, hill after
hill, wooded and softly outlined, trends away in front
till the two shores join together. When the tide is out
there are great, gleaming flats of wet sand, over which
the gulls go flying and crying; and every cape runs down
into them with its little spit of wall and trees. We lay
together a long time on the beach; the sea just babbled
among the stones; and at one time we heard the hollow,
sturdy beat of the paddles of an unseen steamer somewhere
round the cape. I am glad to say that the peace
of the day and scenery was not marred by any unpleasantness
between us two.</p>

<p>I am, unhappily, off my style, and can do nothing
well; indeed, I fear I have marred <i>Roads</i> finally by
patching at it when I was out of the humour. Only, I
am beginning to see something great about John Knox
and Queen Mary; I like them both so much, that I feel
as if I could write the history fairly.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;It has rained and blown chilly out of the
East all day. This was my first visit to church since
the last Sunday at Cockfield. I was alone, and read the
minor prophets and thought of the past all the time; a
sentimental Calvinist preached&mdash;a very odd animal, as
you may fancy&mdash;and to him I did not attend very closely.
All afternoon I worked until half-past four, when I went
out under an umbrella, and cruised about the empty,
wet, glimmering streets until near dinner time.</p>

<p>I have finished <i>Roads</i> to-day, and send it off to you
to see. The Lord knows whether it is worth anything!&mdash;some
of it pleases me a good deal, but I fear it is quite
unfit for any possible magazine. However, I wish you
to see it, as you know the humour in which it was conceived,
walking alone and very happily about the Suffolk
highways and byeways on several splendid sunny afternoons.&mdash;Believe
me, ever your faithful friend,</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;I have looked over <i>Roads</i> again, and I am
aghast at its feebleness. It is the trial of a very &ldquo;&rsquo;prentice
hand&rdquo; indeed. Shall I ever learn to do anything <i>well</i>?
However, it shall go to you, for the reasons given above.</p>


<p class="to">To Mrs Sitwell</p>

<p class="f80">After an outpouring about difficulties at home.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Edinburgh, Tuesday, September 16, 1873.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">... I must</span> be very strong to have all this vexation
and still to be well. I was weighed the other day, and
the gross weight of my large person was eight stone six!
Does it not seem surprising that I can keep the lamp
alight, through all this gusty weather, in so frail a lantern?
And yet it burns cheerily.</p>

<p>My mother is leaving for the country this morning,
and my father and I will be alone for the best part
of the week in this house. Then on Friday I go south to
Dumfries till Monday. I must write small, or I shall
have a tremendous budget by then.</p>

<p>7.20 <i>p.m.</i>&mdash;I must tell you a thing I saw to-day. I
was going down to Portobello in the train, when there
came into the next compartment (third class) an artisan,
strongly marked with smallpox, and with sunken, heavy
eyes&mdash;a face hard and unkind, and without anything
lovely. There was a woman on the platform seeing him
off. At first sight, with her one eye blind and the whole
cast of her features strongly plebeian, and even vicious,
she seemed as unpleasant as the man; but there was
something beautifully soft, a sort of light of tenderness,
as on some Dutch Madonna, that came over her face
when she looked at the man. They talked for a while
together through the window; the man seemed to have
been asking money. &ldquo;Ye ken the last time,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I gave ye two shillin&rsquo;s for your ludgin&rsquo;, and ye said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
it died off into whisper. Plainly Falstaff and Dame
Quickly over again. The man laughed unpleasantly, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>64</span>
cruelly, and said something; and the woman turned her
back on the carriage and stood a long while so, and, do
what I might, I could catch no glimpse of her expression,
although I thought I saw the heave of a sob in her shoulders.
At last, after the train was already in motion, she turned
round and put two shillings into his hand. I saw her
stand and look after us with a perfect heaven of love on
her face&mdash;this poor one-eyed Madonna&mdash;until the train
was out of sight; but the man, sordidly happy with his
gains, did not put himself to the inconvenience of one
glance to thank her for her ill-deserved kindness.</p>

<p>I have been up at the Spec. and looked out a reference
I wanted. The whole town is drowned in white, wet
vapour off the sea. Everything drips and soaks. The
very statues seem wet to the skin. I cannot pretend to
be very cheerful; I did not see one contented face in the
streets; and the poor did look so helplessly chill and
dripping, without a stitch to change, or so much as a fire
to dry themselves at, or perhaps money to buy a meal,
or perhaps even a bed. My heart shivers for them.</p>

<p><i>Dumfries, Friday.</i>&mdash;All my thirst for a little warmth,
a little sun, a little corner of blue sky avails nothing.
Without, the rain falls with a long drawn <i>swish</i>, and the
night is as dark as a vault. There is no wind indeed,
and that is a blessed change after the unruly, bedlamite
gusts that have been charging against one round street
corners and utterly abolishing and destroying all that is
peaceful in life. Nothing sours my temper like these
coarse termagant winds. I hate practical joking; and
your vulgarest practical joker is your flaw of wind.</p>

<p>I have tried to write some verses; but I find I have
nothing to say that has not been already perfectly said
and perfectly sung in <i>Adelaïde</i>. I have so perfect an idea
out of that song! The great Alps, a wonder in the star-light&mdash;the
river, strong from the hills, and turbulent, and
loudly audible at night&mdash;the country, a scented <i>Frühlingsgarten</i>
of orchards and deep wood where the nightingales
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>65</span>
harbour&mdash;a sort of German flavour over all&mdash;and this
love-drunken man, wandering on by sleeping village and
silent town, pours out of his full heart, <i>Einst, O Wunder,
einst</i>, etc. I wonder if I am wrong about this being the
most beautiful and perfect thing in the world&mdash;the only
marriage of really accordant words and music&mdash;both
drunk with the same poignant, unutterable sentiment.</p>

<p>To-day in Glasgow my father went off on some business,
and my mother and I wandered about for two hours.
We had lunch together, and were very merry over what
the people at the restaurant would think of us&mdash;mother
and son they could not suppose us to be.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;And to-day it came&mdash;warmth, sunlight, and a
strong, hearty living wind among the trees. I found myself a
new being. My father and I went off a long walk, through
a country most beautifully wooded and various, under a
range of hills. You should have seen one place where the
wood suddenly fell away in front of us down a long, steep
hill between a double row of trees, with one small fair-haired
child framed in shadow in the foreground; and
when we got to the foot there was the little kirk and kirkyard
of Irongray, among broken fields and woods by the
side of the bright, rapid river. In the kirkyard there was a
wonderful congregation of tombstones, upright and recumbent
on four legs (after our Scotch fashion), and of flat-armed
fir-trees. One gravestone was erected by Scott (at a
cost, I learn, of £70) to the poor woman who served him
as heroine in the <i>Heart of Midlothian</i>, and the inscription
in its stiff, Jedediah Cleishbotham fashion is not without
something touching.<a name="FnAnchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> We went up the stream a little
further to where two Covenanters lie buried in an oak-wood;
the tombstone (as the custom is) containing the
details of their grim little tragedy in funnily bad rhyme,
one verse of which sticks in my memory:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;We died, their furious rage to stay,</p>
<p class="i05">Near to the kirk of Iron-gray.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>66</span></p>

<p>We then fetched a long compass round about through
Holywood Kirk and Lincluden ruins to Dumfries. But
the walk came sadly to grief as a pleasure excursion
before our return....</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Another beautiful day. My father and I
walked into Dumfries to church. When the service was
done I noted the two halberts laid against the pillar of
the churchyard gate; and as I had not seen the little
weekly pomp of civic dignitaries in our Scotch country
towns for some years, I made my father wait. You
should have seen the provost and three bailies going
stately away down the sunlit street, and the two town
servants strutting in front of them, in red coats and cocked
hats, and with the halberts most conspicuously shouldered.
We saw Burns&rsquo;s house&mdash;a place that made me deeply
sad&mdash;and spent the afternoon down the banks of the
Nith. I had not spent a day by a river since we lunched
in the meadows near Sudbury. The air was as pure and
clear and sparkling as spring water; beautiful, graceful
outlines of hill and wood shut us in on every side; and
the swift, brown river fled smoothly away from before
our eyes, rippled over with oily eddies and dimples.
White gulls had come up from the sea to fish, and hovered
and flew hither and thither among the loops of the stream.
By good fortune, too, it was a dead calm between my
father and me. Do you know, I find these rows harder
on me than ever. I get a funny swimming in the head
when they come on that I had not before&mdash;and the like
when I think of them.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Edinburgh</i>], <i>Monday, 22nd September 1873.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> just had another disagreeable to-night. It is
difficult indeed to steer steady among the breakers: I
am always touching ground; generally it is my own
blame, for I cannot help getting friendly with my father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>67</span>
(whom I <i>do</i> love), and so speaking foolishly with my
mouth. I have yet to learn in ordinary conversation
that reserve and silence that I must try to unlearn in
the matter of the feelings.</p>

<p>The news that <i>Roads</i> would do reached me in good
season; I had begun utterly to despair of doing anything.
Certainly I do not think I should be in a hurry
to commit myself about the Covenanters; the whole
subject turns round about me and so branches out to
this side and that, that I grow bewildered; and one
cannot write discreetly about any one little corner of an
historical period, until one has an organic view of the
whole. I have, however&mdash;given life and health&mdash;great
hope of my Covenanters; indeed, there is a lot of
precious dust to be beaten out of that stack even by a
very infirm hand.</p>

<p><i>Much later.</i>&mdash;I can scarcely see to write just now; so
please excuse. We have had an awful scene. All that
my father had to say has been put forth&mdash;not that it was
anything new; only it is the devil to hear. I don&rsquo;t know
what to do&mdash;the world goes hopelessly round about me;
there is no more possibility of doing, living, being anything
but a <i>beast</i>, and there&rsquo;s the end of it.</p>

<p>It is eleven, I think, for a clock struck. O Lord, there
has been a deal of time through our hands since I went
down to supper! All this has come from my own folly;
I somehow could not think the gulf so impassable, and
I read him some notes on the Duke of Argyll<a name="FnAnchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a>&mdash;I thought
he would agree so far, and that we might have some
rational discussion on the rest. And now&mdash;after some
hours&mdash;he has told me that he is a weak man, and that I
am driving him too far, and that I know not what I am
doing. O dear God, this is bad work!</p>

<p>I have lit a pipe and feel calmer. I say, my dear
friend, I am killing my father&mdash;he told me to-night (by
the way) that I alienated utterly my mother&mdash;and this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>68</span>
the result of my attempt to start fair and fresh and to
do my best for all of them.</p>

<p>I must wait till to-morrow ere I finish. I am to-night
too excited.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The sun is shining to-day, which is a great
matter, and altogether the gale having blown off again, I
live in a precarious lull. On the whole I am not displeased
with last night; I kept my eyes open through it
all, and, I think, not only avoided saying anything that
could make matters worse in the future, but said something
that <i>may</i> do good. But a little better or a little
worse is a trifle. I lay in bed this morning awake, for I was
tired and cold and in no special hurry to rise, and heard
my father go out for the papers; and then I lay and
wished&mdash;O, if he would only <i>whistle</i> when he comes in
again! But of course he did not. I have stopped that
pipe.</p>

<p>Now, you see, I have written to you this time and
sent it off, for both of which God forgive me.&mdash;Ever your
faithful friend,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>
<p>My father and I together can put about a year through
in half an hour. Look here, you mustn&rsquo;t take this too
much to heart. I shall be all right in a few hours. It&rsquo;s
impossible to depress me. And of course, when you can&rsquo;t
do anything, there&rsquo;s no need of being depressed. It&rsquo;s
all waste tissue.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> found another &ldquo;flowering isle.&rdquo; All this
beautiful, quiet, sunlit day, I have been out in the country;
down by the sea on my favourite coast between
Granton and Queensferry. There was a delicate, delicious
haze over the firth and sands on one side, and on the
other was the shadow of the woods all riven with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>69</span>
golden rifts of sunshine. A little faint talk of waves
upon the beach; the wild strange crying of seagulls over
the sea; and the hoarse wood-pigeons and shrill, sweet
robins full of their autumn love-making among the trees,
made up a delectable concerto of peaceful noises. I spent
the whole afternoon among these sights and sounds with
Simpson. And we came home from Queensferry on the
outside of the coach and four, along a beautiful way full
of ups and downs among woody, uneven country, laid
out (fifty years ago, I suppose) by my grandfather, on
the notion of Hogarth&rsquo;s line of beauty. You see my taste
for roads is hereditary.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I was wakened this morning by a long flourish
of bugles and a roll upon the drums&mdash;the <i>réveillé</i> at the
Castle. I went to the window; it was a grey, quiet dawn,
a few people passed already up the street between the
gardens, already I heard the noise of an early cab somewhere
in the distance, most of the lamps had been extinguished
but not all, and there were two or three lit
windows in the opposite façade that showed where sick
people and watchers had been awake all night and
knew not yet of the new, cool day. This appealed
to me with a special sadness: how often in the old
times my nurse and I had looked across at these, and
sympathised!</p>

<p>I wish you would read Michelet&rsquo;s <i>Louis Quatorze et la
Révocation de l&rsquo;Édit de Nantes</i>. I read it out in the
garden, and the autumnal trees and weather, and my own
autumnal humour, and the pitiable prolonged tragedies
of Madame and of Molière, as they look, darkling and
sombre, out of their niches in the great gingerbread façade
of the <i>Grand Âge</i>, go wonderfully hand in hand.</p>

<p>I wonder if my revised paper has pleased the Saturday?
If it has not, I shall be rather sorry&mdash;no, very
sorry indeed&mdash;but not surprised and certainly not hurt.
It will be a great disappointment; but I am glad to say
that, among all my queasy, troublesome feelings, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>70</span>
not a sensitive vanity. Not that I am not as conceited
as you know me to be; only I go easy over the coals in
that matter.</p>

<p>I have been out reading Hallam in the garden; and
have been talking with my old friend the gardener, a
man of singularly hard favour and few teeth. He consulted
me this afternoon on the choice of books, premising
that his taste ran mainly on war and travel. On travel
I had to own at once my ignorance. I suggested Kinglake,
but he had read that; and so, finding myself
here unhorsed, I turned about and at last recollected
Southey&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the Admirals</i>, and the volumes of
Macaulay containing the wars of William. Can you
think of any other for this worthy man? I believe him
to hold me in as high an esteem as any one can do;
and I reciprocate his respect, for he is quite an intelligent
companion.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning I read Morley&rsquo;s article aloud
to Bob in one of the walks of the public garden. I was
full of it and read most excitedly; and we were ever,
as we went to and fro, passing a bench where a man sat
reading the Bible aloud to a small circle of the devout.
This man is well known to me, sits there all day, sometimes
reading, sometimes singing, sometimes distributing
tracts. Bob laughed much at the opposition preachers&mdash;I
never noticed it till he called my attention to the other;
but it did not seem to me like opposition&mdash;does it to
you?&mdash;each in his way was teaching what he thought
best.</p>

<p>Last night, after reading Walt Whitman a long while
for my attempt to write about him, I got <i>tête-montée</i>, rushed
out up to M. S., came in, took out <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, and
without giving the poor unbeliever time to object, proceeded
to wade into him with favourite passages. I had
at least this triumph, that he swore he must read some
more of him.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

<p>On the question of the authorship of the <i>Ode to the Cuckoo</i>, which
Burke thought the most beautiful lyric in our language, the debate

Those of Logan have, I believe, been now vindicated past doubt.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Edinburgh</i>], <i>Saturday, October 4, 1873.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is a little sharp to-day; but bright and sunny with
a sparkle in the air, which is delightful after four days of
unintermitting rain. In the streets I saw two men meet
after a long separation, it was plain. They came forward
with a little run and <i>leaped</i> at each other&rsquo;s hands. You
never saw such bright eyes as they both had. It put one
in a good humour to see it.</p>

<p><i>8 p.m.</i>&mdash;I made a little more out of my work than I
have made for a long while back; though even now I
cannot make things fall into sentences&mdash;they only sprawl
over the paper in bald orphan clauses. Then I was about
in the afternoon with Baxter; and we had a good deal
of fun, first rhyming on the names of all the shops we
passed, and afterwards buying needles and quack drugs
from open-air vendors, and taking much pleasure in their
inexhaustible eloquence. Every now and then as we
went, Arthur&rsquo;s Seat showed its head at the end of a street.
Now, to-day the blue sky and the sunshine were both
entirely wintry; and there was about the hill, in these
glimpses, a sort of thin, unreal, crystalline distinctness
that I have not often seen excelled. As the sun began
to go down over the valley between the new town and
the old, the evening grew resplendent; all the gardens
and low-lying buildings sank back and became almost
invisible in a mist of wonderful sun, and the Castle stood
up against the sky, as thin and sharp in outline as a castle
cut out of paper. Baxter made a good remark about
Princes Street, that it was the most elastic street for
length that he knew; sometimes it looks, as it looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>72</span>
to-night, interminable, a way leading right into the heart
of the red sundown; sometimes, again, it shrinks together,
as if for warmth, on one of the withering, clear
east-windy days, until it seems to lie underneath your
feet.</p>

<p>I want to let you see these verses from an <i>Ode to the
Cuckoo</i> written by one of the ministers of Leith in the
middle of last century&mdash;the palmy days of Edinburgh&mdash;who
was a friend of Hume and Adam Smith and the
whole constellation. The authorship of these beautiful
verses has been most truculently fought about; but whoever
wrote them (and it seems as if this Logan had) they
are lovely&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;I have been at church with my mother,
where we heard &ldquo;Arise, shine,&rdquo; sung excellently well,
and my mother was so much upset with it that she nearly
had to leave church. This was the antidote, however, to
fifty minutes of solid sermon, varra heavy. I have been
sticking in to Walt Whitman; nor do I think I have ever
laboured so hard to attain so small a success. Still, the
thing is taking shape, I think; I know a little better what
I want to say all through; and in process of time, possibly
I shall manage to say it. I must say I am a very bad
workman, <i>mais j&rsquo;ai du courage</i>: I am indefatigable at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>73</span>
rewriting and bettering, and surely that humble quality
should get me on a little.</p>

<p><i>Monday, October 6.</i>&mdash;It is a magnificent glimmering
moonlight night, with a wild, great west wind abroad,
flapping above one like an immense banner, and every
now and again swooping furiously against my windows.
The wind is too strong perhaps, and the trees are certainly
too leafless for much of that wide rustle that we both
remember; there is only a sharp, angry, sibilant hiss,
like breath drawn with the strength of the elements through
shut teeth, that one hears between the gusts only. I am
in excellent humour with myself, for I have worked hard
and not altogether fruitlessly; and I wished before I
turned in just to tell you that things were so. My dear
friend, I feel so happy when I think that you remember
me kindly. I have been up to-night lecturing to a friend
on life and duties and what a man could do; a coal off
the altar had been laid on my lips, and I talked quite
above my average, and hope I spread, what you would
wish to see spread, into one person&rsquo;s heart; and with
a new light upon it.</p>

<p>I shall tell you a story. Last Friday I went down to
Portobello, in the heavy rain, with an uneasy wind blowing
<i>par rafales</i> off the sea (or &ldquo;<i>en rafales</i>&rdquo; should it be?
or what?). As I got down near the beach a poor woman,
oldish, and seemingly, lately at least, respectable, followed
me and made signs. She was drenched to the skin,
and looked wretched below wretchedness. You know,
I did not like to look back at her; it seemed as if she
might misunderstand and be terribly hurt and slighted;
so I stood at the end of the street&mdash;there was no one else
within sight in the wet&mdash;and lifted up my hand very
high with some money in it. I heard her steps draw
heavily near behind me, and, when she was near enough
to see, I let the money fall in the mud and went off at my
best walk without ever turning round. There is nothing
in the story; and yet you will understand how much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>74</span>
there is, if one chose to set it forth. You see, she was
so ugly; and you know there is something terribly, miserably
pathetic in a certain smile, a certain sodden aspect
of invitation on such faces. It is so terrible, that it is in
a way sacred; it means the outside of degradation and
(what is worst of all in life) false position. I hope you
understand me rightly.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Edinburgh</i>], <i>Tuesday, October 14, 1873.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">My</span> father has returned in better health, and I am
more delighted than I can well tell you. The one trouble
that I can see no way through is that his health, or my
mother&rsquo;s, should give way. To-night, as I was walking
along Princes Street, I heard the bugles sound the recall.
I do not think I had ever remarked it before; there is
something of unspeakable appeal in the cadence. I felt
as if something yearningly cried to me out of the darkness
overhead to come thither and find rest; one felt as
if there must be warm hearts and bright fires waiting
for one up there, where the buglers stood on the damp
pavement and sounded their friendly invitation forth
into the night.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I may as well tell you exactly about my
health. I am not at all ill; have quite recovered; only
I am what <i>MM. les médecins</i> call below par; which, in
plain English, is that I am weak. With tonics, decent
weather, and a little cheerfulness, that will go away in
its turn, and I shall be all right again.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear what you say about the Exam.;
until quite lately I have treated that pretty cavalierly,
for I say honestly that I do not mind being plucked; I
shall just have to go up again. We travelled with the Lord
Advocate the other day, and he strongly advised me in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>75</span>
my father&rsquo;s hearing to go to the English Bar; and the
Lord Advocate&rsquo;s advice goes a long way in Scotland. It
is a sort of special legal revelation. Don&rsquo;t misunderstand
me. I don&rsquo;t, of course, want to be plucked; but so
far as my style of knowledge suits them, I cannot make
much betterment on it in a month. If they wish
scholarship more exact, I must take a new lease
altogether.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;My head and eyes both gave in this morning,
and I had to take a day of complete idleness. I was
in the open air all day, and did no thought that I could
avoid, and I think I have got my head between my
shoulders again; however, I am not going to do much.
I don&rsquo;t want you to run away with any fancy about
my being ill. Given a person weak and in some trouble,
and working longer hours than he is used to, and you
have the matter in a nutshell. You should have seen
the sunshine on the hill to-day; it has lost now that
crystalline clearness, as if the medium were spring-water
(you see, I am stupid!); but it retains that wonderful
thinness of outline that makes the delicate shape and
hue savour better in one&rsquo;s mouth, like fine wine out of
a finely-blown glass. The birds are all silent now but
the crows. I sat a long time on the stairs that lead down
to Duddingston Loch&mdash;a place as busy as a great town
during frost, but now solitary and silent; and when I
shut my eyes I heard nothing but the wind in the trees;
and you know all that went through me, I dare say, without
my saying it.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;I am now all right. I do not expect any tic
to-night, and shall be at work again to-morrow. I have
had a day of open air, only a little modified by <i>Le Capitaine
Fracasse</i> before the dining-room fire. I must write no
more, for I am sleepy after two nights, to quote my book,
&ldquo;<i>sinon blanches, du moins grises</i>&ldquo;; and so I must go to
bed and faithfully, hoggishly slumber.&mdash;Your faithful</p>

<p>On the advice of the Lord Advocate it had been agreed that
Stevenson should present himself for admission as a student at one
of the London Inns of Court and should come to town after the
middle of October to be examined for that purpose. The following
two letters refer to this purpose and to the formalities required for
effecting it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Edinburgh, Oct. 15, 1873</i>], <i>Wednesday.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Of course I knew as well as you
that I was merely running before an illness; but I thought
I should be in time to escape. However I was knocked
over on Monday night with a bad sore throat, fever, rheumatism,
and a threatening of pleurisy, which last is, I
think, gone. I still hope to be able to get away early
next week, though I am not very clear as to how I shall
manage the journey. If I don&rsquo;t get away on Wednesday
at latest, I lose my excuse for going at all, and I do
wish to escape a little while.</p>

<p>I shall see about the form when I get home, which I
hope will be to-morrow (I was taken ill in a friend&rsquo;s house
and have not yet been moved).</p>

<p>How could a broken-down engineer expect to make
anything of <i>Roads</i>. Requiescant. When we get well
(and if we get well), we shall do something better.&mdash;Yours
sincerely,</p>

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Edinburgh, October 16, 1873</i>], <i>Thursday.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I am at my wits&rsquo; end about this
abominable form of admission. I don&rsquo;t know what the
devil it is; I haven&rsquo;t got one even if I did, and so
can&rsquo;t sign.</p>

<p>Monday night is the very earliest on which (even if I
go on mending at the very great pace I have made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>77</span>
already) I can hope to be in London myself. But possibly
it is only intimation that requires to be made on
Tuesday morning; and one may possess oneself of a
form of admission up to the eleventh hour. I send herewith
a letter which I must ask you to cherish, as I count
it a sort of talisman. Perhaps you may understand it, I
don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand it, please do not trouble and
we must just hope that Tuesday morning will be early
enough to do all. Of course I fear the exam. will spin
me; indeed after this bodily and spiritual crisis I should
not dream of coming up at all; only that I require
it as a pretext for a moment&rsquo;s escape, which I want
much.</p>

<p>I am so glad that <i>Roads</i> has got in. I had almost as
soon have it in the Portfolio as the Saturday; the P. is
so nicely printed and I am <i>gourmet</i> in type. I don&rsquo;t
know how to thank you for your continual kindness to
me; and I am afraid I do not even feel grateful enough&mdash;you
have let your kindnesses come on me so easily.&mdash;Yours

<div class="quote">
<p>When Stevenson a few days later came to London, it was before
the physicians and not the lawyers that he must present himself;
and the result of an examination by Sir Andrew Clark was his
prompt and peremptory despatch to Mentone for a winter&rsquo;s rest and
sunshine at a distance from all causes of mental agitation. This
episode of his life gave occasion to the essay <i>Ordered South</i>, the
only one of his writings in which he took the invalid point of view
or allowed his health troubles in any degree to colour his work.
Travelling south by slow stages, he wrote on the way a long diary-letter
from which extracts follow:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Avignon</i> [<i>November 1873</i>].</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> just read your letter upon the top of the hill
beside the church and castle. The whole air was filled
with sunset and the sound of bells; and I wish I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>78</span>
give you the least notion of the <i>southernness</i> and <i>Provençality</i>
of all that I saw.</p>

<p>I cannot write while I am travelling; <i>c&rsquo;est un défaut;</i>
but so it is. I must have a certain feeling of being at
home, and my head must have time to settle. The new
images oppress me, and I have a fever of restlessness on
me. You must not be disappointed at such shabby
letters; and besides, remember my poor head and the
fanciful crawling in the spine.</p>

<p>I am back again in the stage of thinking there is
nothing the matter with me, which is a good sign; but
I am wretchedly nervous. Anything like rudeness I am
simply babyishly afraid of; and noises, and especially
the sounds of certain voices, are the devil to me. A
blind poet whom I found selling his immortal works in
the streets of Sens, captivated me with the remarkable
equable strength and sweetness of his voice; and I listened
a long while and bought some of the poems; and
now this voice, after I had thus got it thoroughly into my
head, proved false metal and a really bad and horrible
voice at bottom. It haunted me some time, but I think
I am done with it now.</p>

<p>I hope you don&rsquo;t dislike reading bad style like this
as much as I do writing it: it hurts me when neither
words nor clauses fall into their places, much as it would
hurt you to sing when you had a bad cold and your voice
deceived you and missed every other note. I do feel so
inclined to break the pen and write no more; and here
<i>àpropos</i> begins my back.</p>

<p><i>After dinner.</i>&mdash;It blows to-night from the north down
the valley of the Rhone, and everything is so cold that I
have been obliged to indulge in a fire. There is a fine
crackle and roar of burning wood in the chimney which
is very homely and companionable, though it does
seem to postulate a town all white with snow
outside.</p>

<p>I have bought Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s Chateaubriand and am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>79</span>
immensely delighted with the critic. Chateaubriand is
more antipathetic to me than anyone else in the
world.</p>

<p>I begin to wish myself arrived to-night. Travelling,
when one is not quite well, has a good deal of unpleasantness.
One is easily upset by cross incidents, and wants
that <i>belle humeur</i> and spirit of adventure that makes a
pleasure out of what is unpleasant.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, November 11th.</i>&mdash;There! There&rsquo;s a date for
you. I shall be in Mentone for my birthday, with plenty
of nice letters to read. I went away across the Rhone
and up the hill on the other side that I might see the
town from a distance. Avignon followed me with its
bells and drums and bugles; for the old city has no equal
for multitude of such noises. Crossing the bridge and
seeing the brown turbid water foam and eddy about the
piers, one could scarce believe one&rsquo;s eyes when one looked
down upon the stream and saw the smooth blue mirroring
tree and hill. Over on the other side, the sun beat
down so furiously on the white road that I was glad to
keep in the shadow and, when the occasion offered, to
turn aside among the olive-yards. It was nine years and
six months since I had been in an olive-yard. I found
myself much changed, not so gay, but wiser and more
happy. I read your letter again, and sat awhile looking
down over the tawny plain and at the fantastic
outline of the city. The hills seemed just fainting
into the sky; even the great peak above Carpentras
(Lord knows how many metres above the sea) seemed
unsubstantial and thin in the breadth and potency of
the sunshine.</p>

<p>I should like to stay longer here but I can&rsquo;t. I am
driven forward by restlessness, and leave this afternoon
about two. I am just going out now to visit again the
church, castle, and hill, for the sake of the magnificent
panorama, and besides, because it is the friendliest spot
in all Avignon to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>80</span></p>

<p><i>Later.</i>&mdash;You cannot picture to yourself anything more
steeped in hard bright sunshine than the view from the
hill. The immovable inky shadow of the old bridge on
the fleeting surface of the yellow river seemed more solid
than the bridge itself. Just in the place where I sat
yesterday evening a shaven man in a velvet cap was
studying music&mdash;evidently one of the singers for <i>La
Muette de Portici</i> at the theatre to-night. I turned back
as I went away: the white Christ stood out in strong
relief on his brown cross against the blue sky, and the
four kneeling angels and lanterns grouped themselves
about the foot with a symmetry that was almost laughable;
the musician read on at his music, and counted
time with his hand on the stone step.</p>

<p><i>Menton, November 12th.</i>&mdash;My first enthusiasm was
on rising at Orange and throwing open the shutters.
Such a great living flood of sunshine poured in
upon me, that I confess to having danced and expressed
my satisfaction aloud; in the middle of which
the boots came to the door with hot water, to my
great confusion.</p>

<p>To-day has been one long delight, coming to a magnificent
climax on my arrival here. I gave up my baggage
to an hotel porter and set off to walk at once. I was somewhat
confused as yet as to my directions, for the station
of course was new to me, and the hills had not sufficiently
opened out to let me recognise the peaks. Suddenly, as
I was going forward slowly in this confusion of mind, I
was met by a great volley of odours out of the lemon
and orange gardens, and the past linked on to the
present, and in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the
whole scene fell before me into order, and I was at home.
I nearly danced again.</p>

<p>I suppose I must send off this to-night to notify my
arrival in safety and good-humour and, I think, in good
health, before relapsing into the old weekly vein. I hope
this time to send you a weekly dose of sunshine from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>81</span>
south, instead of the jet of <i>snell</i> Edinburgh east wind that
used to was.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

<p class="to">To Mrs. Thomas Stevenson</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Hôtel du Pavillon, Menton,
November 13, 1873.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;The <i>Place</i> is not where I thought;
it is about where the old Post Office was. The Hôtel de
Londres is no more an hotel. I have found a charming
room in the Hôtel du Pavillon, just across the road from
the Prince&rsquo;s Villa; it has one window to the south and
one to the east, with a superb view of Mentone and the
hills, to which I move this afternoon. In the old great
<i>Place</i> there is a kiosque for the sale of newspapers; a
string of omnibuses (perhaps thirty) go up and down
under the plane-trees of the Turin Road on the occasion
of each train; the Promenade has crossed both
streams, and bids fair to reach the Cap Martin. The old
chapel near Freeman&rsquo;s house at the entrance to the Gorbio
valley is now entirely submerged under a shining new
villa, with pavilion annexed; over which, in all the pride
of oak and chestnut and divers coloured marbles, I was
shown this morning by the obliging proprietor. The
Prince&rsquo;s Palace itself is rehabilitated, and shines afar
with white window-curtains from the midst of a garden,
all trim borders and greenhouses and carefully kept
walks. On the other side, the villas are more thronged
together, and they have arranged themselves, shelf after
shelf, behind each other. I see the glimmer of new
buildings, too, as far eastward as Grimaldi; and a
viaduct carries (I suppose) the railway past the mouth
of the bone caves. F. Bacon (Lord Chancellor) made
the remark that &ldquo;Time was the greatest innovator&ldquo;;
it is perhaps as meaningless a remark as was ever made;
but as Bacon made it, I suppose it is better than any
that I could make. Does it not seem as if things were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>82</span>
fluid? They are displaced and altered in ten years so
that one has difficulty, even with a memory so very vivid
and retentive for that sort of thing as mine, in identifying
places where one lived a long while in the past, and
which one has kept piously in mind during all the interval.
Nevertheless, the hills, I am glad to say, are unaltered;
though I dare say the torrents have given them many a
shrewd scar, and the rains and thaws dislodged many a
boulder from their heights, if one were only keen enough
to perceive it. The sea makes the same noise in the
shingle; and the lemon and orange gardens still discharge
in the still air their fresh perfume; and the people have
still brown comely faces; and the Pharmacie Gros still
dispenses English medicines; and the invalids (eheu!)
still sit on the promenade and trifle with their fingers in
the fringes of shawls and wrappers; and the shop of
Pascal Amarante still, in its present bright consummate
flower of aggrandisement and new paint, offers everything
that it has entered into people&rsquo;s hearts to wish
for in the idleness of a sanatorium; and the &ldquo;Château
des Morts&rdquo; is still at the top of the town; and the fort
and the jetty are still at the foot, only there are now two
jetties; and&mdash;I am out of breath. (To be continued in
our next.)</p>

<p>For myself, I have come famously through the journey;
and as I have written this letter (for the first time
for ever so long) with ease and even pleasure, I think my
head must be better. I am still no good at coming down
hills or stairs; and my feet are more consistently cold
than is quite comfortable. But, these apart, I feel well;
and in good spirits all round.</p>

<p>I have written to Nice for letters, and hope to get
them to-night. Continue to address Poste Restante.
Take care of yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,&mdash;I sat a long while up among the
olive yards to-day at a favourite corner, where one has
a fair view down the valley and on to the blue floor of
the sea. I had a Horace with me, and read a little; but
Horace, when you try to read him fairly under the open
heaven, sounds urban, and you find something of the
escaped townsman in his descriptions of the country, just
as somebody said that Morris&rsquo;s sea-pieces were all taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>84</span>
from the coast. I tried for long to hit upon some language
that might catch ever so faintly the indefinable shifting
colour of olive leaves; and, above all, the changes and
little silverings that pass over them, like blushes over
a face, when the wind tosses great branches to and fro;
but the Muse was not favourable. A few birds scattered
here and there at wide intervals on either side of the
valley sang the little broken songs of late autumn; and
there was a great stir of insect life in the grass at my
feet. The path up to this coign of vantage, where I think
I shall make it a habit to ensconce myself a while of a
morning, is for a little while common to the peasant and
a little clear brooklet. It is pleasant, in the tempered
grey daylight of the olive shadows, to see the people
picking their way among the stones and the water and
the brambles; the women especially, with the weights
poised on their heads and walking all from the hips with
a certain graceful deliberation.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I have been to Nice to-day to see Dr.
Bennet; he agrees with Clark that there is no disease;
but I finished up my day with a lamentable exhibition of
weakness. I could not remember French, or at least
I was afraid to go into any place lest I should not be able
to remember it, and so could not tell when the train
went. At last I crawled up to the station and sat down
on the steps, and just steeped myself there in the sunshine
until the evening began to fall and the air to grow
chilly. This long rest put me all right; and I came home
here triumphantly and ate dinner well. There is the full,
true, and particular account of the worst day I have had
since I left London. I shall not go to Nice again for some
time to come.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I am to-day quite recovered, and got into
Mentone to-day for a book, which is quite a creditable
walk. As an intellectual being I have not yet begun to
re-exist; my immortal soul is still very nearly extinct;
but we must hope the best. Now, do take warning by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>85</span>
me. I am set up by a beneficent providence at the corner
of the road, to warn you to flee from the hebetude that is
to follow. Being sent to the South is not much good
unless you take your soul with you, you see; and my
soul is rarely with me here. I don&rsquo;t see much beauty.
I have lost the key; I can only be placid and inert, and
see the bright days go past uselessly one after another;
therefore don&rsquo;t talk foolishly with your mouth any more
about getting liberty by being ill and going south <i>viâ</i>
the sickbed. It is not the old free-born bird that gets
thus to freedom; but I know not what manacled and
hide-bound spirit, incapable of pleasure, the clay of a
man. Go south! Why, I saw more beauty with my eyes
healthfully alert to see in two wet windy February afternoons
in Scotland than I can see in my beautiful olive
gardens and grey hills in a whole week in my low and
lost estate, as the Shorter Catechism puts it somewhere.
It is a pitiable blindness, this blindness of the soul; I
hope it may not be long with me. So remember to
keep well; and remember rather anything than not
to keep well; and again I say, <i>anything</i> rather than
not to keep well.</p>

<p>Not that I am unhappy, mind you. I have found the
words already&mdash;placid and inert, that is what I am. I
sit in the sun and enjoy the tingle all over me, and I am
cheerfully ready to concur with any one who says that
this is a beautiful place, and I have a sneaking partiality
for the newspapers, which would be all very well, if one
had not fallen from heaven and were not troubled with
some reminiscence of the <i>ineffable aurore</i>.</p>

<p>To sit by the sea and to be conscious of nothing
but the sound of the waves, and the sunshine over all
your body, is not unpleasant; but I was an Archangel
once.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;If you knew how old I felt! I am sure this
is what age brings with it&mdash;this carelessness, this disenchantment,
this continual bodily weariness. I am a

<p>To-day has been cloudy and mild; and I have lain a
great while on a bench outside the garden wall (my usual
place now) and looked at the dove-coloured sea and the
broken roof of cloud, but there was no seeing in my eye.
Let us hope to-morrow will be more profitable.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Menton, Sunday</i> [<i>November 30, 1873</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,&mdash;To-day is as hot as it has been in
the sun; and as I was a little tired and seedy, I went
down and just drank in sunshine. A strong wind has
risen out of the west; the great big dead leaves from the
roadside planes scuttled about and chased one another
over the gravel round me with a noise like little waves
under the keel of a boat, and jumped up sometimes on to
my lap and into my face. I lay down on my back at last,
and looked up into the sky. The white corner of the hotel,
with a wide projection at the top, stood out in dazzling
relief; and there was nothing else, save a few of the
plane leaves that had got up wonderfully high and turned
and eddied and flew here and there like little pieces of
gold leaf, to break the extraordinary sea of blue. It
was bluer than anything in the world here; wonderfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>87</span>
blue, and looking deeply peaceful, although in truth there
was a high wind blowing.</p>

<p>I am concerned about the plane leaves. Hitherto it
has always been a great feature to see these trees standing
up head and shoulders and chest&mdash;head and body,
in fact&mdash;above the wonderful blue-grey-greens of the
olives, in one glory of red gold. Much more of this wind,
and the gold, I fear, will be all spent.</p>

<p>9.20.&mdash;I must write you another little word. I have
found here a new friend, to whom I grow daily more
devoted&mdash;George Sand. I go on from one novel to
another and think the last I have read the most sympathetic
and friendly in tone, until I have read another.
It is a life in dreamland. Have you read <i>Mademoiselle
Merquem</i>?</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;I did not quite know last night what to
say to you about <i>Mlle. Merquem</i>. If you want to be
unpleasantly moved, read it.</p>

<p>I am gloomy and out of spirits to-night in consequence
of a ridiculous scene at the <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i>, where a parson
whom I rather liked took offence at something I said
and we had almost a quarrel. It was mopped up and
stifled, like spilt wine with a napkin; but it leaves an
unpleasant impression.</p>

<p>I have again ceased all work, because I felt that it
strained my head a little, and so I have resumed the
tedious task of waiting with folded hands for better
days. But thanks to George Sand and the sunshine, I am
very jolly.</p>

<p>That last word was so much out of key that I could
sit no longer, and went away to seek out my clergyman
and apologise to him. He was gone to bed. I don&rsquo;t know
what makes me take this so much to heart. I suppose it&rsquo;s
nerves or pride or something; but I am unhappy about
it. I am going to drown my sorrows in <i>Consuelo</i> and burn
some incense in my pipe to the god of Contentment and
Forgetfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>88</span></p>

<p>I do not know, but I hope, if I can only get better, I
shall be a help to you soon in every way and no more a
trouble and burthen. All my difficulties about life have
so cleared away; the scales have fallen from my eyes,
and the broad road of my duty lies out straight before me
without cross or hindrance. I have given up all hope,
all fancy rather, of making literature my hold: I see
that I have not capacity enough. My life shall be, if I
can make it, my only business. I am desirous to practise
now, rather than to preach, for I know that I should
ever preach badly, and men can more easily forgive faulty
practice than dull sermons. If Colvin does not think that
I shall be able to support myself soon by literature, I
shall give it up and go (horrible as the thought is to me)
into an office of some sort: the first and main question
is, that I must live by my own hands; after that come the
others.</p>

<p>You will not regard me as a madman, I am sure. It
is a very rational aberration at least to try to put your
beliefs into practice. Strangely enough, it has taken
me a long time to see this distinctly with regard to my
whole creed; but I have seen it at last, praised be my
sickness and my leisure! I have seen it at last; the
sun of my duty has risen; I have enlisted for the first
time, and after long coquetting with the shilling, under
the banner of the Holy Ghost!<a name="FnAnchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>8.15.&mdash;If you had seen the moon last night! It was
like transfigured sunshine; as clear and mellow, only
showing everything in a new wonderful significance. The
shadows of the leaves on the road were so strangely black
that Dowson and I had difficulty in believing that they
were not solid, or at least pools of dark mire. And the
hills and the trees, and the white Italian houses with lit
windows! O! nothing could bring home to you the
keenness and the reality and the wonderful <i>Unheimlichkeit</i>
of all these. When the moon rises every night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>89</span>
over the Italian coast, it makes a long path over the sea
as yellow as gold.</p>

<p>How I happened to be out in the moonlight yesterday,
was that Dowson and I spent the evening with an odd
man called Bates, who played Italian music to us with
great feeling; all which was quite a dissipation in my
still existence.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I cannot endure to be dependent much
longer, it stops my mouth. Something I must find shortly.
I mean when I am able for anything. However I am
much better already; and have been writing not altogether
my worst although not very well. Walt Whitman
is stopped. I have bemired it so atrociously by working
at it when I was out of humour that I must let the colour
dry; and alas! what I have been doing in its place
doesn&rsquo;t seem to promise any money. However it is all
practice and it interests myself extremely. I have now
received £80, some £55 of which still remain; all this is
more debt to civilisation and my fellowmen. When
shall I be able to pay it back? You do not know how
much this money question begins to take more and more
importance in my eyes every day. It is an old phrase
of mine that money is the <i>atmosphere</i> of civilised life, and
I do hate to take the breath out of other people&rsquo;s nostrils.
I live here at the rate of more than £3 a week and I do
nothing for it. If I didn&rsquo;t hope to get well and do good
work yet and more than repay my debts to the world, I
should consider it right to invest an extra franc or two in
laudanum. But I <i>will</i> repay it.&mdash;Always your faithful

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR BAXTER</span>,&mdash;At last, I must write. I must say
straight out that I am not recovering as I could wish.
I am no stronger than I was when I came here, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>90</span>
pay for every walk, beyond say a quarter of a mile in
length, by one or two, or even three, days of more or
less prostration. Therefore let nobody be down upon
me for not writing. I was very thankful to you for
answering my letter; and for the princely action of
Simpson in writing to me, I mean before I had written
to him, I was ditto to an almost higher degree. I hope
one or another of you will write again soon; and, remember,
I still live in hope of reading Grahame Murray&rsquo;s
address.</p>

<p>I have not made a joke, upon my living soul, since I
left London. O! except one, a very small one, that I
had made before, and that I very timidly repeated in a
half-exhilarated state towards the close of dinner, like
one of those dead-alive flies that we see pretending to be
quite light and full of the frivolity of youth in the first
sunshiny days. It was about mothers&rsquo; meetings, and it
was damned small, and it was my ewe lamb&mdash;the Lord
knows I couldn&rsquo;t have made another to save my life&mdash;and
a clergyman quarrelled with me, and there was as nearly
an explosion as could be. This has not fostered my leaning
towards pleasantry. I felt that it was a very cold,
hard world that night.</p>

<p>My dear Charles, is the sky blue at Mentone? Was
that your question? Well, it depends upon what you
call blue; it&rsquo;s a question of taste, I suppose. Is the sky
blue? You poor critter, you never saw blue sky worth
being called blue in the same day with it. And I should
rather fancy that the sun did shine I should. And the
moon doesn&rsquo;t shine either. O no! (This last is sarcastic.)
Mentone is one of the most beautiful places in
the world, and has always had a very warm corner in
my heart since first I knew it eleven years ago.</p>

<p><i>11th December.</i>&mdash;I live in the same hotel with Lord X.
He has black whiskers, and has been successful in raising
some kids; rather a melancholy success; they are weedy
looking kids in Highland clo&rsquo;. They have a tutor with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>91</span>
them who respires Piety and that kind of humble your-lordship&rsquo;s-most-obedient
sort of gentlemanliness that
noblemen&rsquo;s tutors have generally. They all get livings,
these men, and silvery hair and a gold watch from their
attached pupil; and they sit in the porch and make the
watch repeat for their little grandchildren, and tell them
long stories, beginning, &ldquo;When I was private tutor in
the family of,&rdquo; etc., and the grandchildren cock snooks
at them behind their backs and go away whenever they
can to get the groom to teach them bad words.</p>

<p>Sidney Colvin will arrive here on Saturday or Sunday;
so I shall have someone to jaw with. And, seriously, this
is a great want. I have not been all these weeks in idleness,
as you may fancy, without much thinking as to
my future; and I have a great deal in view that may or
may not be possible (that I do not yet know), but that
is at least an object and a hope before me. I cannot
help recurring to seriousness a moment before I stop;
for I must say that living here a good deal alone, and
having had ample time to look back upon my past, I
have become very serious all over. If I can only get
back my health, by God! I shall not be as useless as I
have been.&mdash;Ever yours, <i>mon vieux</i>,</p>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> first violet. There is more sweet trouble for the
heart in the breath of this small flower than in all the
wines of all the vineyards of Europe. I cannot contain
myself. I do not think so small a thing has ever given
me such a princely festival of pleasure. I feel as if my
heart were a little bunch of violets in my bosom; and
my brain is pleasantly intoxicated with the wonderful
odour. I suppose I am writing nonsense, but it does
not seem nonsense to me. Is it not a wonderful odour?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>92</span>
is it not something incredibly subtle and perishable? It
is like a wind blowing to one out of fairyland. No one
need tell me that the phrase is exaggerated if I say that
this violet <i>sings</i>; it sings with the same voice as the
March blackbird; and the same adorable tremor goes
through one&rsquo;s soul at the hearing of it.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;All yesterday I was under the influence of
opium. I had been rather seedy during the night and
took a dose in the morning, and for the first time in my
life it took effect upon me. I had a day of extraordinary
happiness; and when I went to bed there was something
almost terrifying in the pleasures that besieged me in the
darkness. Wonderful tremors filled me; my head swam
in the most delirious but enjoyable manner; and the
bed softly oscillated with me, like a boat in a very gentle
ripple. It does not make me write a good style apparently,
which is just as well, lest I should be tempted to
renew the experiment; and some verses which I wrote
turn out on inspection to be not quite equal to <i>Kubla
Khan</i>. However, I was happy, and the recollection is
not troubled by any reaction this morning.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Do you know, I think I am much better.
I really enjoy things, and I really feel dull occasionally,
neither of which was possible with me before; and though
I am still tired and weak, I almost think I feel a stirring
among the dry bones. O, I should like to recover, and
be once more well and happy and fit for work! And
then to be able to begin really to my life; to have done,
for the rest of time, with preluding and doubting; and
to take hold of the pillars strongly with Samson&mdash;to
burn my ships with (whoever did it). O, I begin to feel
my spirits come back to me again at the thought!</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I sat along the beach this morning under
some reeds (or canes&mdash;I know not which they are): everything
was so tropical; nothing visible but the glaring
white shingle, the blue sea, the blue sky, and the green
plumes of the canes thrown out against the latter some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>93</span>
ten or fifteen feet above my head. The noise of the surf
alone broke the quiet. I had somehow got <i>Ueber allen
Gipfeln ist Ruh</i> into my head; and I was happy for I
do not know how long, sitting there and repeating to
myself these lines. It is wonderful how things somehow
fall into a full satisfying harmony, and out of the fewest
elements there is established a sort of small perfection.
It was so this morning. I did not want anything further.</p>

<p>In the third week of December I went out to join my friend for
a part of the Christmas vacation, and found him without tangible
disease, but very weak and ailing: ill-health and anxiety, however,
neither then nor at any time diminished his charm as a companion.
He left Mentone to meet me at the old town of Monaco, where we
spent a few days and from whence these stray notes of nature and
human nature were written.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Monaco, Tuesday</i> [<i>December 1873</i>]</p>

<p><span class="sc">We</span> have been out all day in a boat; lovely weather
and almost dead calm, only the most infinitesimal and
indeterminate of oscillations moved us hither and thither;
the sails were duly set, and flapped about idly overhead.
Our boatman was a man of a delightful humour, who
told us many tales of the sea, notably one of a doctor,
who was an Englishman, and who seemed almost an
epitome of vices&mdash;drunken, dishonest, and utterly without
faith; and yet he was a <i>charmant garçon</i>. He told
us many amusing circumstances of the doctor&rsquo;s incompetence
and dishonesty, and imitated his accent with a
singular success. I couldn&rsquo;t quite see that he was a
charming <i>garçon</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>O, oui</i>&mdash;<i>comme caractère, un charmant
garçon</i>.&rdquo; We landed on that Cap Martin, the place of
firs and rocks and myrtle and rosemary of which I spoke to
you. As we pulled along in the fresh shadow, the wonderfully
clean scents blew out upon us, as if from islands of
spice&mdash;only how much better than cloves and cinnamon!</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Colvin and I are sitting on a seat on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>94</span>
battlemented gardens of Old Monaco. The day is grey
and clouded, with a little red light on the horizon, and the
sea, hundreds of feet below us, is a sort of purple dove-colour.
Shrub-geraniums, firs, and aloes cover all available
shelves and terraces, and where these become
impossible, the prickly pear precipitates headlong downwards
its bunches of oval plates; so that the whole
face of the cliff is covered with an arrested fall (please
excuse clumsy language), a sort of fall of the evil angels
petrified midway on its career. White gulls sail past
below us every now and then, sometimes singly, sometimes
by twos and threes, and sometimes in a great flight.
The sharp perfume of the shrub-geraniums fills the air.</p>

<p>I cannot write, in any sense of the word; but I am as
happy as can be, and wish to notify the fact, before it
passes. The sea is blue, grey, purple and green; very
subdued and peaceful; earlier in the day it was marbled
by small keen specks of sun and larger spaces of faint
irradiation; but the clouds have closed together now,
and these appearances are no more. Voices of children
and occasional crying of gulls; the mechanical noise of
a gardener somewhere behind us in the scented thicket;
and the faint report and rustle of the waves on the precipice
far below, only break in upon the quietness to render
it more complete and perfect.</p>

<p>After spending a few days in one of the more retired hotels of
Monte Carlo, we went on to Mentone and settled at the Hotel
Mirabeau, long since, I believe, defunct, near the eastern extremity
of the town. The little American girl mentioned in the last paragraph
is the same we shall meet later under her full name of Marie
Johnstone.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Hotel Mirabeau, Menton</i>], <i>January 2nd, 1874</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Here</span> I am over in the east bay of Mentone, where
I am not altogether sorry to find myself. I move so little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>95</span>
that I soon exhaust the immediate neighbourhood of my
dwelling places. Our reason for coming here was however
very simple. Hobson&rsquo;s choice. Mentone during my
absence has filled marvellously.</p>

<p>Continue to address P. R.<a name="FnAnchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Menton; and try to conceive
it as possible that I am not a drivelling idiot. When
I wish an address changed, it is quite on the cards that
I shall be able to find language explicit enough to express
the desire. My whole desire is to avoid complication of
addresses. It is quite fatal. If two P. R.&rsquo;s have contradictory
orders they will continue to play battledoor
and shuttlecock with an unhappy epistle, which will never
get farther afield but perish there miserably.</p>

<p>You act too much on the principle that whatever I
do is done unwisely; and that whatever I do not, has
been culpably forgotten. This is wounding to my nat&rsquo;ral
vanity.</p>

<p>I have not written for three days I think; but what
days! They were very cold; and I must say I was able
thoroughly to appreciate the blessings of Mentone. Old
Smoko this winter would evidently have been very summary
with me. I could not stand the cold at all. I
exhausted all my own and all Colvin&rsquo;s clothing; I then
retired to the house, and then to bed; in a condition of
sorrow for myself unequalled. The sun is forth again
(laus Deo) and the wind is milder, and I am greatly re-established.
A certain asperity of temper still lingers,
however, which Colvin supports with much mildness.</p>

<p>In this hotel, I have a room on the first floor! Luxury,
however, is not altogether regardless of expense. We only
pay 13 francs per day&mdash;3&frac12; more than at the Pavillon on
the third floor.&mdash;And beggars must not be choosers. We
were very nearly houseless, the night we came. And it
is rarely that such winds of adversity blow men into
king&rsquo;s Palaces.</p>

<p>Looking over what has gone before, it seems to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>96</span>
that it is not strictly polite. I beg to withdraw all that
is offensive.</p>

<p>At <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i>, we have some people who amuse us
much; two Americans, who would try to pass for French
people, and their daughter, the most charming of little
girls. Both Colvin and I have planned an abduction
already. The whole hotel is devoted to her; and the
waiters continually do smuggle out comfits and fruit and
pudding to her.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Menton</i>], <i>Sunday, January 4, 1874</i>.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;We have here fallen on the very
pink of hotels. I do not say that it is more pleasantly
conducted than the Pavillon, for that were impossible;
but the rooms are so cheery and bright and new, and
then the food! I never, I think, so fully appreciated
the phrase &ldquo;the fat of the land&rdquo; as I have done since I
have been here installed. There was a dish of eggs at
<i>déjeûner</i> the other day, over the memory of which I lick
my lips in the silent watches.</p>

<p>Now that the cold has gone again, I continue to keep
well in body, and already I begin to walk a little more.
My head is still a very feeble implement, and easily set
a-spinning; and I can do nothing in the way of work
beyond reading books that may, I hope, be of some use
to me afterwards.</p>

<p>I was very glad to see that M&rsquo;Laren was sat upon,
and principally for the reason why. Deploring as I do
much of the action of the Trades Unions, these conspiracy
clauses and the whole partiality of the Master and Servant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>97</span>
Act are a disgrace to our equal laws. Equal laws become
a byeword when what is legal for one class becomes a
criminal offence for another. It did my heart good to
hear that man tell M&rsquo;Laren how, as he had talked much
of getting the franchise for working men, he must now
be content to see them use it now they had got it. This
is a smooth stone well planted in the foreheads of certain
dilettanti radicals, after M&rsquo;Laren&rsquo;s fashion, who are willing
to give the working men words and wind, and votes and
the like, and yet think to keep all the advantages, just
or unjust, of the wealthier classes without abatement.
I do hope wise men will not attempt to fight the working
men on the head of this notorious injustice. Any
such step will only precipitate the action of the newly
enfranchised classes, and irritate them into acting hastily;
when what we ought to desire should be that they should
act warily and little for many years to come, until education
and habit may make them the more fit.</p>

<p>All this (intended for my father) is much after the
fashion of his own correspondence. I confess it has left
my own head exhausted; I hope it may not produce
the same effect on yours. But I want him to look really
into this question (both sides of it, and not the representations
of rabid middle-class newspapers, sworn to
support all the little tyrannies of wealth), and I know he
will be convinced that this is a case of unjust law; and
that, however desirable the end may seem to him, he will
not be Jesuit enough to think that any end will justify
an unjust law.</p>

Zassetsky and Madame Garschine, whose society and that of their
children was to do so much to cheer Stevenson during his remaining
months on the Riviera. The French painter Robinet (sometimes in
his day known as <i>le Raphael des cailloux</i>, from the minuteness of

<p>Into the bargain with Marie, the American girl, who
is grace itself, and comes leaping and dancing simply
like a wave&mdash;like nothing else, and who yesterday was
Queen out of the Epiphany cake and chose Robinet (the
French painter) as her <i>favori</i> with the most pretty confusion
possible&mdash;into the bargain with Marie, we have
two little Russian girls, with the youngest of whom, a
little polyglot button of a three-year old, I had the most
laughable little scene at lunch to-day. I was watching
her being fed with great amusement, her face being as
broad as it is long, and her mouth capable of unlimited
extension; when suddenly, her eye catching mine, the
fashion of her countenance was changed, and regarding
me with a really admirable appearance of offended dignity,
she said something in Italian which made everybody
laugh much. It was explained to me that she had said
I was very <i>polisson</i> to stare at her. After this she was
somewhat taken up with me, and after some examination
she announced emphatically to the whole table, in German,
that I was a <i>Mädchen</i>; which word she repeated with
shrill emphasis, as though fearing that her proposition
would be called in question&mdash;<i>Mädchen, Mädchen, Mädchen,
Mädchen</i>. This hasty conclusion as to my sex she was
led afterwards to revise, I am informed; but her new
opinion (which seems to have been something nearer the
truth) was announced in a third language quite unknown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>99</span>
to me, and probably Russian. To complete the scroll of
her accomplishments, she was brought round the table
after the meal was over, and said good-bye to me in very
commendable English.</p>

<p>The weather I shall say nothing about, as I am incapable
of explaining my sentiments upon that subject

I begin to recognise myself occasionally now and again,

<p>Please remember me very kindly to Professor Swan; I
wish I had a story to send him; but story, Lord bless you,

satisfaction.</p>

<p>The two Russian ladies are from Georgia all the way.
They do not at all answer to the description of Georgian
slaves however, being graceful and refined, and only good-looking
after you know them a bit.</p>

<p>Please remember me very kindly to the Jenkins, and
thank them for having asked about me. Tell Mrs. J. that
I am engaged perfecting myself in the &ldquo;Gallic idiom,&rdquo;
in order to be a worthier Vatel for the future. Monsieur
Folleté, our host, is a Vatel by the way. He cooks himself,
and is not insensible to flattery on the score of his
table. I began, of course, to complain of the wine (part
of the routine of life at Mentone); I told him that where
one found a kitchen so exquisite, one astonished oneself
that the wine was not up to the same form. &ldquo;Et voilà
précisément mon côté faible, monsieur,&rdquo; he replied, with
an indescribable amplitude of gesture. &ldquo;Que voulez-vous?
Moi, je suis cuisinier!&rdquo; It was as though Shakespeare,
called to account for some such peccadillo as the
Bohemian seaport, should answer magnificently that he
was a poet. So Folleté lives in a golden zone of a certain
sort&mdash;a golden, or rather torrid zone, whence he issues
twice daily purple as to his face&mdash;and all these clouds
and vapours and ephemeral winds pass far below him and
disturb him not.</p>

<p>He has another hobby however&mdash;his garden, round
which it is his highest pleasure to lead the unwilling guest.
Whenever he is not in the kitchen, he is hanging round
loose, seeking whom he may show his garden to. Much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>101</span>
of my time is passed in studiously avoiding him, and I
have brought the art to a very extreme pitch of perfection.
The fox, often hunted, becomes wary.&mdash;Ever your affectionate
son,</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Menton</i>], <i>Tuesday, 13th January 1874.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">... I lost</span> a Philipine to little Mary Johnstone last
night; so to-day I sent her a rubbishing doll&rsquo;s toilet, and
a little note with it, with some verses telling how happy
children made every one near them happy also, and
advising her to keep the lines, and some day, when she
was &ldquo;grown a stately demoiselle,&rdquo; it would make her
&ldquo;glad to know she gave pleasure long ago,&rdquo; all in a very
lame fashion, with just a note of prose at the end, telling
her to mind her doll and the dog, and not trouble her
little head just now to understand the bad verses; for
some time when she was ill, as I am now, they would be
plain to her and make her happy. She has just been
here to thank me, and has left me very happy. Children
are certainly too good to be true.</p>

<p>Yesterday I walked too far, and spent all the afternoon
on the outside of my bed; went finally to rest at
nine, and slept nearly twelve hours on the stretch. Bennet
(the doctor), when told of it this morning, augured well
for my recovery; he said youth must be putting in strong;
of course I ought not to have slept at all. As it was,
I dreamed <i>horridly</i>; but not my usual dreams of social
miseries and misunderstandings and all sorts of crucifixions
of the spirit; but of good, cheery, physical things&mdash;of
long successions of vaulted, dimly lit cellars full of
black water, in which I went swimming among toads and
unutterable, cold, blind fishes. Now and then these cellars
opened up into sort of domed music-hall places, where
one could land for a little on the slope of the orchestra,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>102</span>
but a sort of horror prevented one from staying long,
and made one plunge back again into the dead waters.
Then my dream changed, and I was a sort of Siamese
pirate, on a very high deck with several others. The ship
was almost captured, and we were fighting desperately.
The hideous engines we used and the perfectly incredible
carnage that we effected by means of them kept me cheery,
as you may imagine; especially as I felt all the time my
sympathy with the boarders, and knew that I was only
a prisoner with these horrid Malays. Then I saw a signal
being given, and knew they were going to blow up the
ship. I leaped right off, and heard my captors splash
in the water after me as thick as pebbles when a bit of
river bank has given way beneath the foot. I never
heard the ship blow up; but I spent the rest of the night
swimming about some piles with the whole sea full of
Malays, searching for me with knives in their mouths.
They could swim any distance under water, and every
now and again, just as I was beginning to reckon myself
safe, a cold hand would be laid on my ankle&mdash;ugh!</p>

<p>However, my long sleep, troubled as it was, put me
all right again, and I was able to work acceptably this
morning and be very jolly all day. This evening I have
had a great deal of talk with both the Russian ladies;
they talked very nicely, and are bright, likable women
both. They come from Georgia.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 10.30.</i>&mdash;We have all been to tea to-night
at the Russians&rsquo; villa. Tea was made out of a samovar,
which is something like a small steam engine, and whose
principal advantage is that it burns the fingers of all who
lay their profane touch upon it. After tea Madame Z.
played Russian airs, very plaintive and pretty; so the
evening was Muscovite from beginning to end. Madame
G.&rsquo;s daughter danced a tarantella, which was very pretty.</p>

<p>Whenever Nelitchka cries&mdash;and she never cries except
from pain&mdash;all that one has to do is to start &ldquo;Malbrook
s&rsquo;en va-t-en guerre.&rdquo; She cannot resist the attraction;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>103</span>
she is drawn through her sobs into the air; and in a
moment there is Nellie singing, with the glad look that
comes into her face always when she sings, and all the
tears and pain forgotten.</p>

<p>It is wonderful, before I shut this up, how that child
remains ever interesting to me. Nothing can stale her
infinite variety; and yet it is not very various. You see
her thinking what she is to do or to say next, with a funny
grave air of reserve, and then the face breaks up into a
smile, and it is probably &ldquo;Berecchino!&rdquo; said with that
sudden little jump of the voice that one knows in children,
as the escape of a jack-in-the-box, and, somehow, I am
quite happy after that!</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,&mdash;It is still so cold, I cannot tell
you how miserable the weather is. I have begun my
&ldquo;Walt Whitman&rdquo; again seriously. Many winds have
blown since I last laid it down, when sickness took me
in Edinburgh. It seems almost like an ill-considered jest
to take up these old sentences, written by so different a
person under circumstances so different, and try to string
them together and organise them into something anyway
whole and comely; it is like continuing another man&rsquo;s
book. Almost every word is a little out of tune to me
now but I shall pull it through for all that and make
something that will interest you yet on this subject that
I had proposed to myself and partly planned already,
before I left for Cockfield last July.</p>

<p>I am very anxious to hear how you are. My own
health is quite very good; I am a healthy octogenarian;
very old, I thank you and of course not so active as a
young man, but hale withal: a lusty December. This is
so; such is R. L. S.</p>

<p>I am a little bothered about Bob, a little afraid that
he is living too poorly. The fellow he chums with spends
only two francs a day on food, with a little excess every
day or two to keep body and soul together, and though
Bob is not so austere I am afraid he draws it rather too
fine himself.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;We have all got our photographs; it is
pretty fair, they say, of me and as they are particular
in the matter of photographs, and besides partial judges
I suppose I may take that for proven. Of Nellie there
is one quite adorable. The weather is still cold. My
&ldquo;Walt Whitman&rdquo; at last looks really well: I think it
is going to get into shape in spite of the long gestation.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Still cold and grey, and a high imperious
wind off the sea. I see nothing particularly <i>couleur de
rose</i> this morning: but I am trying to be faithful to my
creed and hope. O yes, one can do something to make
things happier and better; and to give a good example
before men and show them how goodness and fortitude
and faith remain undiminished after they have been
stripped bare of all that is formal and outside. We must
do that; you have done it already; and I shall follow
and shall make a worthy life, and you must live to
approve of me.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Yes</span>, I am much better; very much better I think I
may say. Although it is funny how I have ceased to be
able to write with the improvement of my health. Do
you notice how for some time back you have had no
descriptions of anything? The reason is that I can&rsquo;t
describe anything. No words come to me when I see a
thing. I want awfully to tell you to-day about a little
&ldquo;<i>piece</i>&rdquo; of green sea, and gulls, and clouded sky with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>105</span>
the usual golden mountain-breaks to the southward. It
was wonderful, the sea near at hand was living emerald;
the white breasts and wings of the gulls as they circled
above&mdash;high above even&mdash;were dyed bright green by the
reflection. And if you could only have seen or if any
right word would only come to my pen to tell you how
wonderfully these illuminated birds floated hither and
thither under the grey purples of the sky!</p>

<p>To-day has been windy but not cold. The sea was
troubled and had a fine fresh saline smell like our own
seas, and the sight of the breaking waves, and above all
the spray that drove now and again in my face, carried
me back to storms that I have enjoyed, O how much! in
other places. Still (as Madame Zassetsky justly remarked)
there is something irritating in a stormy sea whose waves
come always to the same spot and never farther: it looks
like playing at passion: it reminds one of the loathsome
sham waves in a stage ocean.</p>

<p>It had been a very cold Christmas at Monaco and Monte Carlo,
and Stevenson had no adequate overcoat, so it was agreed that
when I went to Paris I should try and find him a warm cloak or
wrap. I amused myself looking for one suited to his taste for the
picturesque and piratical in apparel, and found one in the style
of 1830-40, dark blue and flowing, and fastening with a snake
buckle.</p>

note. This morning I am stupid again; can do nothing
at all; am no good &ldquo;comme plumitif.&rdquo; I think it must
be the cold outside. At least that would explain my
addled head and intense laziness.</p>

<p>O why did you tell me about that cloak? Why didn&rsquo;t
you buy it? Isn&rsquo;t it in <i>Julius Cæsar</i> that Pompey blames&mdash;no
not Pompey but a friend of Pompey&rsquo;s&mdash;well, Pompey&rsquo;s
friend, I mean the friend of Pompey&mdash;blames somebody
else who was his friend&mdash;that is who was the friend of
Pompey&rsquo;s friend&mdash;because he (the friend of Pompey&rsquo;s
friend) had not done something right off, but had come
and asked him (Pompey&rsquo;s friend) whether he (the friend
of Pompey&rsquo;s friend) ought to do it or no? There I fold
my hands with some complacency: that&rsquo;s a piece of very
good narration. I am getting into good form. These
classical instances are always distracting. I was talking
of the cloak. It&rsquo;s awfully dear. Are there no cheap and
nasty imitations? Think of that&mdash;if, however, it were
the opinion (ahem) of competent persons that the great
cost of the mantle in question was no more than proportionate

to its durability; if it were to be a joy for

me in anything like integrity for the comfort of my

(as it seems) the quality of <i>perdurability</i> in the fabric; if,
in fact, it would not be extravagant, but only the leariest
economy to lay out £5 .. 15 .. in a single mantle without
seam and without price, and if&mdash;and if&mdash;it really fastens

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">........</p>

<p>4. Nelitchka, or Nelitska, as you know already by this
time, is my adorable kid&rsquo;s name. Her laugh does more
good to one&rsquo;s health than a month at the seaside: as
she said to-day herself, when asked whether she was a
boy or a girl, after having denied both with gravity, she
is an angel.</p>

<p>5. O no, her brain is not in a chaos; it is only the
brains of those who hear her. It is all plain sailing for
her. She wishes to refuse or deny anything, and there is
the English &ldquo;No fank you&rdquo; ready to her hand; she
wishes to admire anything, and there is the German
&ldquo;schön&ldquo;; she wishes to sew (which she does with admirable
seriousness and clumsiness), and there is the French
&ldquo;coudre&ldquo;; she wishes to say she is ill, and there is the
Russian &ldquo;bulla&ldquo;; she wishes to be down on any one,
and there is the Italian &ldquo;Berecchino&ldquo;; she wishes to play
at a railway train, and there is her own original word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>108</span>
&ldquo;Collie&rdquo; (say the o with a sort of Gaelic twirl). And all
these words are equally good.</p>

<p>7. I am called M. Stevenson by everybody except
Nelitchka, who calls me M. Berecchino.</p>

<p>8. The weather to-day is no end: as bright and as
warm as ever. I have been out on the beach all afternoon
with the Russians. Madame Garschine has been
reading Russian to me; and I cannot tell prose from
verse in that delectable tongue, which is a pity. Johnson
came out to tell us that Corsica was visible, and there it
was over a white, sweltering sea, just a little darker than
the pallid blue of the sky, and when one looked at it
closely, breaking up into sun-brightened peaks.</p>

<p>I may mention that Robinet has never heard an
Englishman with so little accent as I have&mdash;ahem&mdash;ahem&mdash;eh?&mdash;What
do you say to that? I don&rsquo;t suppose I
have said five sentences in English to-day; all French;
all bad French, alas!</p>

<p>I am thought to be looking better. Madame Zassetsky
said I was all green when I came here first, but
that I am all right in colour now, and she thinks fatter.
I am very partial to the Russians; I believe they are
rather partial to me. I am supposed to be an <i>esprit
observateur! À mon age, c&rsquo;est étonnant comme je suis
observateur!</i></p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Menton, January 1874.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR S. C.</span>,&mdash;I suppose this will be my last note
then. I think you will find everything very jolly here, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>109</span>
am very jolly myself. I worked six hours to-day. I
am occupied in transcribing <i>The Bottle</i>, which is pleasant
work to me; I find much in it that I still think excellent
and much that I am doubtful about; my convention
is so terribly difficult that I have to put out much that
pleases me, and much that I still preserve I only preserve
with misgiving. I wonder if my convention is not
a little too hard and too much in the style of those
decadent curiosities, poems without the letter E, poems
going with the alphabet and the like. And yet the idea,
if rightly understood and treated as a convention always
and not as an abstract principle, should not so much
hamper one as it seems to do. The idea is not, of course,
to put in nothing but what would naturally have been
noted and remembered and handed down, but not to
put in anything that would make a person stop and say&mdash;how
could this be known? Without doubt it has the
advantage of making one rely on the essential interest
of a situation and not cocker up and validify feeble
intrigue with incidental fine writing and scenery, and
pyrotechnic exhibitions of inappropriate cleverness and
sensibility. I remember Bob once saying to me that
the quadrangle of Edinburgh University was a good
thing and our having a talk as to how it could be employed
in different arts. I then stated that the different doors
and staircases ought to be brought before a reader of a
story not by mere recapitulation but by the use of them,
by the descent of different people one after another by
each of them. And that the grand feature of shadow
and the light of the one lamp in the corner should also
be introduced only as they enabled people in the story
to see one another or prevented them. And finally that
whatever could not thus be worked into the evolution of
the action had no right to be commemorated at all. After
all, it is a story you are telling; not a place you are to
describe; and everything that does not attach itself to
the story is out of place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>110</span></p>

<p>This is a lecture not a letter, and it seems rather like
sending coals to Newcastle to write a lecture to a subsidised
professor. I hope you have seen Bob by this
time. I know he is anxious to meet you and I am in
great anxiety to know what you think of his prospects&mdash;frankly,
of course: as for his person, I don&rsquo;t care a damn
what you think of it: I am case-hardened in that matter.</p>

<p><span class="sc">... Last</span> night I had a quarrel with the American
on politics. It is odd how it irritates you to hear certain
political statements made. He was excited, and he
began suddenly to abuse our conduct to America. I, of
course, admitted right and left that we had behaved disgracefully
(as we had); until somehow I got tired of
turning alternate cheeks and getting duly buffeted; and
when he said that the Alabama money had not wiped
out the injury, I suggested, in language (I remember) of
admirable directness and force, that it was a pity they
had taken the money in that case. He lost his temper
at once, and cried out that his dearest wish was a war
with England; whereupon I also lost my temper, and,
thundering at the pitch of my voice, I left him and went
away by myself to another part of the garden. A very
tender reconciliation took place, and I think there will
come no more harm out of it. We are both of us nervous
people, and he had had a very long walk and a good deal
of beer at dinner: that explains the scene a little. But
I regret having employed so much of the voice with
which I have been endowed, as I fear every person in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>111</span>
the hotel was taken into confidence as to my sentiments,
just at the very juncture when neither the sentiments nor
(perhaps) the language had been sufficiently considered.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;You have not yet heard of my book?&mdash;<i>Four
Great Scotsmen</i>&mdash;John Knox, David Hume, Robert Burns,
Walter Scott. These, their lives, their work, the social
media in which they lived and worked, with, if I can so
make it, the strong current of the race making itself felt
underneath and throughout&mdash;this is my idea. You must
tell me what you think of it. The Knox will really be
new matter, as his life hitherto has been disgracefully
written, and the events are romantic and rapid; the
character very strong, salient, and worthy; much interest
as to the future of Scotland, and as to that part of him
which was truly modern under his Hebrew disguise.
Hume, of course, the urbane, cheerful, gentlemanly, letter-writing
eighteenth century, full of attraction, and much
that I don&rsquo;t yet know as to his work. Burns, the sentimental
side that there is in most Scotsmen, his poor
troubled existence, how far his poems were his personally,
and how far national, the question of the framework of
society in Scotland, and its fatal effect upon the finest
natures. Scott again, the ever delightful man, sane,
courageous, admirable; the birth of Romance, in a dawn
that was a sunset; snobbery, conservatism, the wrong
thread in History, and notably in that of his own land.

<p>I had a political quarrel last night with the American;
it was a real quarrel for about two minutes; we relieved

led us to a most moving reconciliation, in which the
American vowed he would shed his best blood for
England. In looking back upon the interview, I feel
that I have learned something; I scarcely appreciated
how badly England had behaved, and how well she
deserves the hatred the Americans bear her. It would
have made you laugh if you could have been present and
seen your unpatriotic son thundering anathemas in the
moonlight against all those that were not the friend of
England. Johnson being nearly as nervous as I, we were
both very ill after it, which added a further pathos to
the reconciliation.</p>

<p>Madame Zassetsky is Nelitchka&rsquo;s mamma. They have
both husbands, and they are in Russia, and the ladies are
both here for their health. They make it very pleasant

<p>I read J. H. A. Macdonald&rsquo;s speech with interest; his
sentiments are quite good, I think. I would support him
against M&rsquo;Laren at once. What has disgusted me most
as yet about this election is the detestable proposal to do
away with the income tax. Is there no shame about the
easy classes? Will those who have nine hundred and
ninety-nine thousandths of the advantage of our society,
never consent to pay a single tax unless it is to be paid
also by those who have to bear the burthen and heat of
the day, with almost none of the reward? And the
selfishness here is detestable, because it is so deliberate.
A man may not feel poverty very keenly and may live
a quiet self-pleasing life in pure thoughtlessness; but it
is quite another matter when he knows thoroughly what
the issues are, and yet wails pitiably because he is asked
to pay a little more, even if it does fall hardly sometimes,
than those who get almost none of the benefit. It is like
the healthy child crying because they do not give him
a goody, as they have given to his sick brother to take
away the taste of the dose. I have not expressed myself
clearly; but for all that, you ought to understand, I
think.</p>

<p><i>Friday, February 6th.</i>&mdash;The wine has arrived, and a

the Villa Marina; Nellie in a little red satin cap, in a red
satin suit of boy&rsquo;s clothes, with a funny little black tail
that stuck out behind her, and wagged as she danced
about the room, and gave her a look of Puss in Boots;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>115</span>
Pella as a contadina; Monsieur Robinet as an old woman,

delicate, Oxfordish, etc.</p>

<p>My cloak is the most admirable of all garments. For
warmth, unequalled; for a sort of pensive, Roman stateliness,
sometimes warming into Romantic guitarism, it is
simply without concurrent; it starts alone. If you could
see me in my cloak, it would impress you. I am hugely
better, I think: I stood the cold these last few days without
trouble, instead of taking to bed, as I did at Monte
Carlo. I hope you are going to send the Scotch music.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Menton, February 6, 1874</i>], <i>Friday.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Last</span> night we had a masquerade at the Villa Marina.
Pella was dressed as a contadina and looked beautiful;
and little Nellie, in red satin cap and wonderful red satin
jacket and little breeches as of a nondescript impossible
boy; to which Madame Garschine had slily added a
little black tail that wagged comically behind her as she
danced about the room, and got deliriously tilted up over
the middle bar of the back of her chair as she sat at tea,
with an irresistible suggestion of Puss in Boots&mdash;well,
Nellie thus masqueraded (to get back to my sentence
again) was all that I could have imagined. She held
herself so straight and stalwart, and had such an infinitesimal
dignity of carriage; and then her big baby face,
already quite definitely marked with her sex, came in so
funnily atop that she got clear away from all my power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>116</span>
of similes and resembled nothing in the world but Nellie
in masquerade. Then there was Robinet in a white night
gown, old woman&rsquo;s cap (<i>mutch</i>, in my vernacular), snuff-box
and crutch doubled up and yet leaping and gyrating
about the floor with incredible agility; and lastly, Mademoiselle
in a sort of elderly walking-dress and with blue
spectacles. And all this incongruous impossible world
went tumbling and dancing and going hand in hand, in
flying circles to the music; until it was enough to make
one forget one was in this wicked world, with Conservative
majorities and Presidents MacMahon and all other
abominations about one.</p>

<p>Also last night will be memorable to me for another
reason, Madame Zassetsky having given me a light as
to my own intellect. They were talking about things in
history remaining in their minds because they had assisted
them to generalisations. And I began to explain how
things remained in my mind yet more vividly for no
reason at all. She got interested, and made me give her
several examples; then she said, with her little falsetto
of discovery, &ldquo;Mais c&rsquo;est que vous êtes tout simplement
enfant!&rdquo; This <i>mot</i> I have reflected on at leisure and
there is some truth in it. Long may I be so. Yesterday
too I finished <i>Ordered South</i> and at last had some pleasure
and contentment with it. S. C. has sent it off to Macmillan&rsquo;s
this morning and I hope it may be accepted; I
don&rsquo;t care whether it is or no except for the all-important
lucre; the end of it is good, whether the able editor sees
it or no.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

I have but little hope of seeing again between the

I hired a poor old cabman, whose uncomfortable vehicle
and sorry horse make everyone despise him, and set off
to get money and say farewells. It was a dark misty
evening; the mist was down over all the hills; the peach-trees
in beautiful pink bloom. Arranged my plans; that
merits a word by the way if I can be bothered. I have
half arranged to go to Göttingen in summer to a course of
lectures. Galitzin is responsible for this. He tells me
the professor is to law what Darwin has been to Natural
History, and I should like to understand Roman Law
and a knowledge of law is so necessary for all I hope
to do.</p>

<p>My poor old cabman; his one horse made me three-quarters
of an hour too late for dinner, but I had not the

<h3>STUDENT DAYS&mdash;<i>Concluded</i></h3>

<h5>HOME AGAIN&mdash;LITERATURE AND LAW</h5>

<h6><span class="sc">May 1874&mdash;June 1875</span></h6>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Returning</span> to Edinburgh by way of Paris in May 1874,
Stevenson went to live with his parents at Swanston and
Edinburgh and resumed his reading for the Bar. Illness
and absence had done their work, and the old harmony
of the home was henceforth quite re-established. In his
spare time during the next year he worked hard at his
chosen art, trying his hand at essays, short stories,
criticisms, and prose poems. In all this experimental
writing he had neither the aims nor the facility of the
journalist, but strove always after the higher qualities
of literature, and was never satisfied with what he had
done. To find for all he had to say words of vital aptness
and animation&mdash;to communicate as much as possible of
what he has somewhere called &ldquo;the incommunicable thrill
of things&ldquo;&mdash;was from the first his endeavour in literature,
nay more, it was the main passion of his life: and the
instrument that should serve his purpose could not be
forged in haste. Neither was it easy for this past master
of the random, the unexpected, the brilliantly back-foremost
and topsy-turvy in talk, to learn in writing the
habit of orderly arrangement and organic sequence which
even the lightest forms of literature cannot lack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>124</span></p>

<p>In the course of this summer Stevenson&rsquo;s excursions
included a week or two spent with me at Hampstead,
during which he joined the Savile Club and made some
acquaintance with London literary society; a yachting
trip with his friend Sir Walter Simpson in the western
islands of Scotland; a journey to Barmouth and Llandudno
with his parents; and in the late autumn a walking
tour in Buckinghamshire. The Scottish winter (1874-75)
tried him severely, as Scottish winters always did, but
was enlivened by a new and what was destined to be a
very fruitful and intimate friendship, the origin of which
was described in the following letters, namely that of
Mr. W. E. Henley. In April 1875 he made his first visit,
in the company of his cousin R. A. M. Stevenson to the
artist haunts of the forest of Fontainebleau, whence he
returned to finish his reading for the Scottish Bar and
face the examination which was before him in July. During
all this year, as will be seen, his chief, almost his
exclusive, correspondents and confidants continued to be
the same as in the preceding winter.</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;I went up the hill a little this afternoon.
The air was invigorating, but it was so cold that my scalp
was sore. With this high wintry wind, and the grey sky,
and faint northern daylight, it was quite wonderful to
hear such a clamour of blackbirds coming up to me out
of the woods, and the bleating of sheep being shorn in a
field near the garden, and to see golden patches of blossom
already on the furze, and delicate green shoots upright
and beginning to frond out, among last year&rsquo;s russet
bracken. Flights of crows were passing continually between
the wintry leaden sky and the wintry cold-looking hills.
It was the oddest conflict of seasons. A wee rabbit&mdash;this
year&rsquo;s making, beyond question&mdash;ran out from under my

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Yesterday I received a letter that gave
me much pleasure from a poor fellow-student of mine,
who has been all winter very ill, and seems to be but
little better even now. He seems very much pleased with
<i>Ordered South</i>. &ldquo;A month ago,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I could
scarcely have ventured to read it; to-day I felt on reading
it as I did on the first day that I was able to sun myself
a little in the open air.&rdquo; And much more to the like
effect. It is very gratifying.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

short, and I am so out of the humour. Otherwise very
calm and jolly: cold still <i>impossible</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I feel happier about the <i>Fables</i>, and it is
warmer a bit; but my body is most decrepit, and I can
just manage to be cheery and tread down hypochondria
under foot by work. I lead such a funny life, utterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>128</span>
without interest or pleasure outside of my work: nothing,
indeed, but work all day long, except a short walk alone
on the cold hills, and meals, and a couple of pipes with
my father in the evening. It is surprising how it suits
me, and how happy I keep.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;My dear Stevenson how do you do? do
you annoying yourself or no? when we go to the Olivses
it allways rememberse us you. Nelly and my aunt went
away. And when the organ come and play the Soldaten
it mak us think of Nelly. It is so sad I allmoste went
away. I make my baths; and then we go to Franzensbad;
will you come to see us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is Pella&rsquo;s letter facsimile, punctuation, spelling

the blues a bit; I think it very likely I may run over to
Franzensbad for a week or so this autumn, if I am wanted
that is to say: I shall be able to afford it easily.</p>

<p>I have got on rather better with the <i>Fables</i>; perhaps
it won&rsquo;t be a failure, though I fear. To-day the sun shone
brightly although the wind was cold: I was up the hill
a good time. It is very solemn to see the top of one hill
steadfastly regarding you over the shoulder of another:
I never before to-day fully realised the haunting of such
a gigantic face, as it peers over into a valley and seems
to command all corners. I had a long talk with the shepherd
about foreign lands, and sheep. A Russian had
once been on the farm as a pupil; he told me that he
had the utmost pity for the Russian&rsquo;s capacities, since
(dictionary and all) he had never managed to understand
him; it must be remembered that my friend the shepherd
spoke Scotch of the broadest and often enough employs
words which I do not understand myself.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;I have received such a nice long letter
(four sides) from Leslie Stephen to-day about my <i>Victor
Hugo</i>. It is accepted. This ought to have made me gay,
but it hasn&rsquo;t. I am not likely to be much of a tonic
to-night. I have been very cynical over myself to-day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>129</span>
partly, perhaps, because I have just finished some of the
deedest rubbish about Lord Lytton&rsquo;s <i>Fables</i> that an

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>130</span>
some stuff about Lord Lytton, but I had not the heart
to submit it to you. I sent it direct to Morley, with a
Spartan billet. God knows it is bad enough; but it cost

me labour incredible. I was so out of the vein, it would
have made you weep to see me digging the rubbish out

<p><span class="sc">Another</span> cold day; yet I have been along the hillside,
wondering much at idiotic sheep, and raising partridges
at every second step. One little plover is the object of
my firm adherence. I pass his nest every day, and if you
saw how he flies by me, and almost into my face, crying
and flapping his wings, to direct my attention from his
little treasure, you would have as kind a heart to him as
I. To-day I saw him not, although I took my usual
way; and I am afraid that some person has abused his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>132</span>
simple wiliness and harried (as we say in Scotland) the
nest. I feel much righteous indignation against such
imaginary aggressor. However, one must not be too
chary of the lower forms. To-day I sat down on a tree-stump
at the skirt of a little strip of planting, and thoughtlessly
began to dig out the touchwood with an end of
twig. I found I had carried ruin, death, and universal
consternation into a little community of ants; and this
set me a-thinking of how close we are environed with
frail lives, so that we can do nothing without spreading
havoc over all manner of perishable homes and interests
and affections; and so on to my favourite mood of an
holy terror for all action and all inaction equally&mdash;a
sort of shuddering revulsion from the necessary responsibilities
of life. We must not be too scrupulous of others,
or we shall die. Conscientiousness is a sort of moral
opium; an excitant in small doses, perhaps, but at bottom
a strong narcotic.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;I have been two days in Edinburgh, and
so had not the occasion to write to you. Morley has
accepted the <i>Fables</i>, and I have seen it in proof, and think
less of it than ever. However, of course, I shall send you
a copy of the magazine without fail, and you can be as
disappointed as you like, or the reverse if you can. I
would willingly recall it if I could.</p>

<p>Try, by way of change, Byron&rsquo;s <i>Mazeppa</i>; you will be
astonished. It is grand and no mistake, and one sees
through it a fire, and a passion, and a rapid intuition
of genius, that makes one rather sorry for one&rsquo;s own
generation of better writers, and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to
say; I was going to say &ldquo;smaller men&ldquo;; but that&rsquo;s
not right; read it, and you will feel what I cannot express.
Don&rsquo;t be put out by the beginning; persevere, and you
will find yourself thrilled before you are at an end with it.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;The white mist has obliterated the hills
and lies heavily round the cottage, as though it were
laying siege to it; the trees wave their branches in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>133</span>
wind, with a solemn melancholy manner, like people
swaying themselves to and fro in pain. I am alone in
the house, all the world being gone to church; and even
in here at the side of the fire, the air clings about one
like a wet blanket. Yet this morning, when I was just
awake, I had thought it was going to be a fine day. First,
a cock crew, loudly and beautifully and often; then
followed a long interval of silence and darkness, the grey
morning began to get into my room; and then from the
other side of the garden, a blackbird executed one long
flourish, and in a moment as if a spring had been touched
or a sluice-gate opened, the whole garden just brimmed
and ran over with bird-songs.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>For a part of June Stevenson had come south, spending most of
his time in lodgings with me at Hampstead (where he got the idea
for part of his essay <i>Notes on the Movements of Young Children</i>) and
making his first appearance at the Savile Club. Trouble awaited
him after his return.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Swanston, June 1874</i>], <i>Wednesday.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">News</span> reaches me that Bob is laid down with diphtheria;
and you know what that means.</p>

<p><i>Night.</i>&mdash;I am glad to say that I have on the whole a
good account of Bob and I do hope he may pull through
in spite of all. I went down and saw the doctor; but it
is not thought right that I should go in to see him in
case of contagion: you know it is a very contagious malady.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;It is curious how calm I am in such a case.
I wait with perfect composure for farther news; I can
do nothing; why should I disturb myself? And yet if
things go wrong I shall be in a fine way I can tell
you.</p>

<p>How curiously we are built up into our false positions.
The other day, having toothache and the black dog on
my back generally, I was rude to one of the servants at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>134</span>
the dinner-table. And nothing of course can be more
disgusting than for a man to speak harshly to a young
woman who will lose her place if she speak back to him;
and of course I determined to apologise. Well, do you
know, it was perhaps four days before I found courage
enough, and I felt as red and ashamed as could be. Why?
because I had been rude? not a bit of it; because I
was doing a thing that would be called ridiculous in thus
apologising. I did not know I had so much respect of
middle-class notions before; this is my right hand which
I must cut off. Hold the arm please: once&mdash;twice&mdash;thrice:
the offensive member is amputated: let us hope
I shall never be such a cad any more as to be ashamed
of being a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Night.</i>&mdash;I suppose I must have been more affected
than I thought; at least I found I could not work this
morning and had to go out. The whole garden was
filled with a high westerly wind, coming straight out of
the hills and richly scented with furze&mdash;or whins, as we
would say. The trees were all in a tempest and roared
like a heavy surf; the paths all strewn with fallen apple-blossom
and leaves. I got a quiet seat behind a yew
and went away into a meditation. I was very happy after
my own fashion, and whenever there came a blink of
sunshine or a bird whistled higher than usual, or a little
powder of white apple-blossom came over the hedge and
settled about me in the grass, I had the gladdest little
flutter at my heart and stretched myself for very voluptuousness.
I wasn&rsquo;t altogether taken up with my private
pleasures, however, and had many a look down ugly vistas
in the future, for Bob and others. But we must all be
content and brave, and look eagerly for these little passages
of happiness by the wayside, and go on afterwards,
savouring them under the tongue.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Our garden has grown beautiful at last,
beautiful with fresh foliage and daisied grass. The sky
is still cloudy and the day perhaps even a little gloomy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>135</span>
but under this grey roof, in this shaded temperate light,
how delightful the new summer is.</p>

<p>When I shall come to London must always be problematical
like all my movements, and of course this sickness
of Bob&rsquo;s makes it still more uncertain. If all goes
well I may have to go to the country and take care of him
in his convalescence. But I shall come shortly. Do not
hurry to write to me; I had rather <i>you</i> had ten minutes
more of good, friendly sleep, than I a longer letter; and
you know I am rather partial to your letters. Yesterday,
by the bye, I received the proof of <i>Victor Hugo</i>; it
is not nicely written, but the stuff is capital, I think.
Modesty is my most remarkable quality, I may remark
in passing.</p>

<p>1.30.&mdash;I was out, behind the yew hedge, reading the
<i>Comtesse de Rudolstadt</i> when I found my eyes grow weary,
and looked up from the book. O the rest of the quiet
greens and whites, of the daisied surface! I was very
peaceful, but it began to sprinkle rain and so I fain to
come in for a moment and chat with you. By the way,
I must send you <i>Consuelo</i>; you said you had quite forgotten
it if I remember aright; and surely a book that
could divert me, when I thought myself on the very edge
of the grave, from the work that I so much desired and
was yet unable to do, and from many painful thoughts,
should somewhat support and amuse you under all the
hard things that may be coming upon you. If you should
wonder why I am writing to you so voluminously, know
that it is because I am not suffering myself to work, and
in idleness, as in death, etc.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;I have had a very cruel day. I heard this
morning that yesterday Bob had been very much worse
and I went down to Portobello with all sorts of horrible
presentiments. I was glad when I turned the corner and
saw the blinds still up. He was definitely better, if the
word definitely can be used about such a detestably
insidious complaint. I have ordered <i>Consuelo</i> for you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>136</span>
and you should have it soon this week; I mean next
week of course; I am thinking when you will receive
this letter, not of now when I am writing it.</p>

<p>I am so tired; but I am very hopeful. All will be well
some time, if it be only when we are dead. One thing I
see so clearly. Death is the end neither of joy nor sorrow.
Let us pass into the clods and come up again as grass and
flowers; we shall still be this wonderful, shrinking, sentient
matter&mdash;we shall still thrill to the sun and grow relaxed
and quiet after rain, and have all manner of pains and
pleasures that we know not of now. Consciousness, and
ganglia, and suchlike, are after all but theories. And
who knows? This God may not be cruel when all is done;
he may relent and be good to us <i>à la fin des fins</i>. Think
of how he tempers our afflictions to us, of how tenderly
he mixes in bright joys with the grey web of trouble and
care that we call our life. Think of how he gives, who
takes away. Out of the bottom of the miry clay I write
this; and I look forward confidently; I have faith after
all; I believe, I hope, I <i>will</i> not have it reft from me;
there <i>is</i> something good behind it all, bitter and terrible
as it seems. The infinite majesty (as it will be always in
regard to us the bubbles of an hour) the infinite majesty
must have moments, if it were no more, of greatness; must
sometimes be touched with a feeling for our infirmities,
must sometimes relent and be clement to those frail playthings
that he has made, and made so bitterly alive. Must
it not be so, my dear friend, out of the depths I cry? I
feel it, now when I am most painfully conscious of his
cruelty. He must relent. He must reward. He must
give some indemnity, if it were but in the quiet of a daisy,
tasting of the sun and the soft rain and the sweet shadow
of trees, for all the dire fever that he makes us bear in
this poor existence. We make too much of this human
life of ours. It may be that two clods together, two
flowers together, two grown trees together touching each
other deliciously with their spread leaves, it may be that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>137</span>
these dumb things have their own priceless sympathies,
surer and more untroubled than ours.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know quite whether I have wandered. Forgive
me, I feel as if I had relieved myself; so perhaps it may
not be unpleasant for you either.&mdash;Believe me, ever your
faithful friend,</p>

<p class="to">To Mrs. Sitwell</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Swanston, Sunday</i> (<i>June 1874</i>).</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR FRIEND</span>,&mdash;I fear to have added something to
your troubles by telling you of the grief in which I find
myself; but one cannot always come to meet a friend
smiling, although we should try for the best cheer possible.
All to-day I have been very weary, resting myself after
the trouble and fatigue of yesterday. The day was warm
enough, but it blew a whole gale of wind; and the noise
and the purposeless rude violence of it somehow irritated
and depressed me. There was good news however, though
the anxiety must still be long. O peace, peace, whither
are you fled and where have you carried my old quiet
humour? I am so bitter and disquiet and speak even
spitefully to people. And somehow, though I promise
myself amendment, day after day finds me equally rough
and sour to those about me. But this would pass with
good health and good weather; and at bottom I am not
unhappy; the soil is still good although it bears thorns;
and the time will come again for flowers.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I got your letter this morning and have
to thank you so much for it. Bob is much better; and
I do hope out of danger. To-day has been more glorious
than I can tell you. It has been the first day of blue
sky that we have had; and it was happiness for a week
to see the clear bright outline of the hills and the glory
of sunlit foliage and the darkness of green shadows, and
the big white clouds that went voyaging overhead deliberately.
My two cousins from Portobello were here; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>138</span>
they and I and Maggie ended the afternoon by lying half
an hour together on a shawl. The big cloud had all been
carded out into a thin luminous white gauze, miles away;
and miles away too seemed the little black birds that
passed between this and us as we lay with faces upturned.
The similarity of what we saw struck in us a curious
similarity of mood; and in consequence of the small size
of the shawl, we all lay so close that we half pretended,
half felt, we had lost our individualities and had become
merged and mixed up in a quadruple existence. We
had the shadow of an umbrella over ourselves, and when
any one reached out a brown hand into the golden sunlight
overhead we all feigned that we did not know whose hand
it was, until at last I don&rsquo;t really think we quite did.
Little black insects also passed over us and in the same
half wanton manner we pretended we could not distinguish
them from the birds. There was a splendid sunlit
silence about us, and as Katharine said the heavens seemed
to be dropping oil on us, or honey-dew&mdash;it was all so
bland.</p>

<p><i>Thursday evening</i>.&mdash;I have seen Bob again, and I
am charmed at his convalescence. Le bon Dieu has
been <i>so</i> bon this time: here&rsquo;s his health! Still the danger
is not over by a good way; it is so miserable a thing
for reverses.</p>

<p>I hear the wind outside roaring among our leafy trees
as the surf on some loud shore. The hill-top is whelmed
in a passing rain-shower and the mist lies low in the valleys.
But the night is warm and in our little sheltered garden
it is fair and pleasant, and the borders and hedges and
evergreens and boundary trees are all distinct in an equable
diffusion of light from the buried moon and the day not
altogether passed away. My dear friend, as I hear the
wind rise and die away in that tempestuous world of
foliage, I seem to be conscious of I know not what breath
of creation. I know what this warm wet wind of the
west betokens, I know how already, in this morning&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>139</span>
sunshine, we could see all the hills touched and accentuated
with little delicate golden patches of young fern;
how day by day the flowers thicken and the leaves unfold;
how already the year is a-tip-toe on the summit of its
finished youth; and I am glad and sad to the bottom
of my heart at the knowledge. If you knew how different
I am from what I was last year; how the knowledge of
you has changed and finished me, you would be glad and
sad also.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

contributions towards it which he printed in the Portfolio ever
re-published until after the writer&rsquo;s death. <i>The Appeal to the Clergy
of the Church of Scotland</i> was printed in 1874, published as a pamphlet
in February 1875, and attracted, I believe, no attention whatever.
The &ldquo;fables&rdquo; must have been some of the earliest numbers of the
series continued at odd times till near the date of his death and
published posthumously: I do not know which, but should guess
<i>The House of Eld</i>, <i>Yellow Paint</i>, and perhaps those in the vein
of Celtic mystery, <i>The Touchstone</i>, <i>The Poor Thing</i>, <i>The Song of
To-morrow</i>.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;What is new with you? There
is nothing new with me: Knox and his females begin to
get out of restraint altogether; the subject expands so
damnably, I know not where to cut it off. I have another
paper for the PTFL<a name="FnAnchor_15" href="#Footnote_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> on the stocks: a sequel to the
two others; also, that is to say, a word in season as to
contentment and a hint to the careless to look around
them for disregarded pleasures. Seeley wrote to me
asking me &ldquo;to propose&rdquo; something: I suppose he means&mdash;well,
I suppose I don&rsquo;t know what he means. But I
shall write to him (if you think it wise) when I send him
this paper, saying that my writing is more a matter of
God&rsquo;s disposition than of man&rsquo;s proposal; that I had
from <i>Roads</i> upward ever intended to make a little budget
of little papers all with this intention before them, call
it ethical or æsthetic as you will; and thus I shall leave
it to him (if he likes) to regard this little budget, as slowly
they come forth, as a unity in its own small way. Twelve
or twenty such essays, some of them mainly ethical and
expository, put together in a little book with narrow
print in each page, antique, vine leaves about, and the
following title.</p>

<p class="noind">You know the class of old book I have in my head. I
smack my lips; would it not be nice! I am going to
launch on Scotch ecclesiastical affairs, in a tract addressed
to the Clergy; in which doctrinal matters being laid
aside, I contend simply that they should be just and
dignified men at a certain crisis: this for the honour of
humanity. Its authorship must, of course, be secret or
the publication would be useless. You shall have a copy
of course, and may God help you to understand it.</p>

<p>I have done no more to my fables. I find I must let
things take their time. I am constant to my schemes;
but I must work at them fitfully as the humour moves.</p>

<p>&mdash;To return, I wonder, if I have to make a budget of
such essays as I dream, whether Seeley would publish
them: I should give them unity, you know, by the
doctrinal essays; nor do I think these would be the least
agreeable. You must give me your advice and tell me

<p>The last paragraph of the following means that Dr. Appleton,
the amiable and indefatigable editor of the Academy, then recently
founded, had been a little disturbed in mind by some of the contributions
of his brilliant young friend, but allowed his academic
conscience to be salved by the fact of their signature.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Am I mad? Have I lived thus
long and have you known me thus long, to no purpose?
Do you imagine I could ever write an essay a month, or
promise an essay even every three months? I declare I
would rather die than enter into any such arrangement.
The Essays must fall from me, Essay by Essay, as they
ripen; and all that my communication with Seeley would
effect would be to make him see more in them than mere
occasional essays; or at least <i>look</i> far more faithfully, in
which spirit men rarely look in vain. You know both
<i>Roads</i> and my little girls<a name="FnAnchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> are a part of the scheme which
dates from early at Mentone. My word to Seeley, therefore,
would be to inform him of what I hope will lie ultimately
behind them, of how I regard them as contributions
towards a friendlier and more thoughtful way of looking
about one, etc. One other purpose of telling him would
be that I should feel myself more at liberty to write as I
please, and not bound to drag in a tag about Art every
time to make it more suitable. Tying myself down to
time is an impossibility. You know my own description
of myself as a person with a poetic character and no poetic
talent: just as my prose muse has all the ways of a poetic
one, and I must take my Essays as they come to me. If
I got 12 of &rsquo;em done in two years, I should be pleased.
Never, please, let yourself imagine that I am fertile; I
am constipated in the brains.</p>

<p>Look here, Appleton dined here last night and was
delightful after the manner of our Appleton: I was none

the less pleased, because I was somewhat amused, to
hear of your kind letter to him in defence of my productions.
I was amused at the tranquil dishonesty with

<p class="rt"><i>Train between Edinburgh and
Chester, August</i> 8, 1874.</p>

<p><span class="sc">My</span> father and mother reading. I think I shall talk to
you for a moment or two. This morning at Swanston,
the birds, poor creatures, had the most troubled hour or
two; evidently there was a hawk in the neighbourhood;
not one sang; and the whole garden thrilled with little
notes of warning and terror. I did not know before that
the voice of birds could be so tragically expressive. I
had always heard them before express their trivial satisfaction
with the blue sky and the return of daylight.
Really, they almost frightened me; I could hear mothers
and wives in terror for those who were dear to them; it
was easy to translate, I wish it were as easy to write;
but it is very hard in this flying train, or I would write
you more.</p>

<p><i>Chester.</i>&mdash;I like this place much; but somehow I feel
glad when I get among the quiet eighteenth century
buildings, in cosy places with some elbow room about
them, after the older architecture. This other is bedevilled
and furtive; it seems to stoop; I am afraid of
trap-doors, and could not go pleasantly into such houses.
I don&rsquo;t know how much of this is legitimately the effect
of the architecture; little enough possibly; possibly
far the most part of it comes from bad historical
novels and the disquieting statuary that garnishes some
façades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>145</span></p>

<p>On the way, to-day, I passed through my dear Cumberland
country. Nowhere to as great a degree can one find
the combination of lowland and highland beauties; the
outline of the blue hills is broken by the outline of many
tumultuous tree-clumps; and the broad spaces of moorland
are balanced by a network of deep hedgerows that
might rival Suffolk, in the foreground.&mdash;How a railway
journey shakes and discomposes one, mind and body!
I grow blacker and blacker in humour as the day goes
on; and when at last I am let out, and have the fresh
air about me, it is as though I were born again, and
the sick fancies flee away from my mind like swans in
spring.</p>

<p>I want to come back on what I have said about
eighteenth century and middle-age houses: I do not
know if I have yet explained to you the sort of loyalty,
of urbanity, that there is about the one to my mind; the
spirit of a country orderly and prosperous, a flavour of
the presence of magistrates and well-to-do merchants in
bag-wigs, the clink of glasses at night in fire-lit parlours,
something certain and civic and domestic, is all about
these quiet, staid, shapely houses, with no character but
their exceeding shapeliness, and the comely external
utterance that they make of their internal comfort. Now
the others are, as I have said, both furtive and bedevilled;
they are sly and grotesque; they combine their sort of
feverish grandeur with their sort of secretive baseness,
after the manner of a Charles the Ninth. They are peopled
for me with persons of the same fashion. Dwarfs and
sinister people in cloaks are about them; and I seem
to divine crypts, and, as I said, trap-doors. O God be
praised that we live in this good daylight and this good
peace.</p>

<p><i>Barmouth, August 9th.</i>&mdash;To-day we saw the cathedral
at Chester; and, far more delightful, saw and heard a
certain inimitable verger who took us round. He was
full of a certain recondite, far-away humour that did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>146</span>
quite make you laugh at the time, but was somehow
laughable to recollect. Moreover, he had so far a just
imagination, and could put one in the right humour for
seeing an old place, very much as, according to my favourite
text, Scott&rsquo;s novels and poems do for one. His account
of the monks in the Scriptorium, with their cowls over
their heads, in a certain sheltered angle of the cloister
where the big cathedral building kept the sun off the
parchments, was all that could be wished; and so too
was what he added of the others pacing solemnly behind
them and dropping, ever and again, on their knees before
a little shrine there is in the wall, &ldquo;to keep &rsquo;em in the
frame of mind.&rdquo; You will begin to think me unduly biassed
in this verger&rsquo;s favour if I go on to tell you his opinion of
me. We got into a little side chapel, whence we could
hear the choir children at practice, and I stopped a moment
listening to them, with, I dare say, a very bright face,
for the sound was delightful to me. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re <i>very</i> fond of music.&rdquo; I said I was. &ldquo;Yes, I
could tell that by your head,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
deal in that head.&rdquo; And he shook his own solemnly. I said
it might be so, but I found it hard, at least, to get it out.
Then my father cut in brutally, said anyway I had no
ear, and left the verger so distressed and shaken in the
foundations of his creed that, I hear, he got my father
aside afterwards and said he was sure there was something
in my face, and wanted to know what it was,
if not music. He was relieved when he heard that I
occupied myself with literature (which word, note here,
I do now spell correctly). Good-night, and here&rsquo;s the
verger&rsquo;s health!</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Yesterday received the letter you know of.
I have finished my Portfolio paper, not very good but
with things in it: I don&rsquo;t know if they will take it; and I
have got a good start made with my <i>John Knox</i> articles.
The weather here is rainy and miserable and windy: it
is warm and not over boisterous for a certain sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>147</span>
pleasure. This place, as I have made my first real
inquisition into it to-night is curious enough; all the
days I have been here, I have been at work, and so I
was quite new to it.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;A most beautiful day. We took a most
beautiful drive, also up the banks of the river. The
heather and furze are in flower at once and make up a
splendid richness of colour on the hills; the trees were
beautiful; there was a bit of winding road with larches
on one hand and oaks on the other; the oaks were in
shadow and printed themselves off at every corner on the
sunlit background of the larches. We passed a little
family of children by the roadside. The youngest of all
sat a good way apart from the others on the summit of
a knoll; it was ensconced in an old tea-box, out of which
issued its head and shoulders in a blue cloak and scarlet
hat. O if you could have seen its dignity! It was
deliciously humorous: and this little piece of comic self-satisfaction
was framed in wonderfully by the hills and
the sunlit estuary. We saw another child in a cottage
garden. She had been sick, it seemed, and was taking
the air quietly for health&rsquo;s sake. Over her pale face, she
had decorated herself with all available flowers and weeds;
and she was driving one chair as a horse, sitting in another
by way of carriage. We cheered her as we passed, and
she acknowledged the compliment like a queen. I like
children better every day, I think, and most other things
less. <i>John Knox</i> goes on, and a horrible story of a nurse
which I think almost too cruel to go on with: I wonder
why my stories are always so nasty.<a name="FnAnchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> I am still well,
and in good spirits. I say, by the way, have you any
means of finding Madame Garschine&rsquo;s address. If you
have, communicate with me. I fear my last letter has
been too late to catch her at Franzensbad; and so I shall
have to go without my visit altogether, which would
vex me.</p>

do anything, yes and shall do everything, to make it a
little better for people. I wish I could lose no time; I

<p>It is raining here; and I have been working at John

I only work at it by fits and starts, because I feel as if
it were a sort of crime against humanity&mdash;it is so cruel.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I saw such nice children again to-day;
one little fellow alone by the roadside, putting a stick
into a spout of water and singing to himself&mdash;so wrapt
up that we had to poke him with our umbrellas to attract
his attention; and again, two solid, fleshly, grave, double-chinned
burgomasters in black, with black hats on &rsquo;em,
riding together in what they call, I think, a double perambulator.
My father is such fun here. He is always
skipping about into the drawing-room, and speaking to
all the girls, and telling them God knows what about us
all. My mother and I are the old people who sit aloof,
receive him as a sort of prodigal when he comes back
to us, and listen indulgently to what he has to tell.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;I took my usual walk before turning in last
night, and dallied over it a little. It was a cool, dark,
solemn night, starry, but the sky charged with big black
clouds. The lights in house windows you could see, but
the houses themselves were lost in the general blackness.
A church clock struck eleven as I went past, and rather
startled me. The whiteness of the road was all I had to
go by. I heard an express train roaring away down the
coast into the night, and dying away sharply in the distance;
it was like the noise of an enormous rocket, or a
shot world, one would fancy. I suppose the darkness
made me a little fanciful; but when at first I was puzzled
by this great sound in the night, between sea and hills,
I thought half seriously that it might be a world broken
loose&mdash;this world to wit. I stood for I suppose five
seconds with this looking-for of destruction in my head,
not exactly frightened but put out; and I wanted badly
not to be overwhelmed where I was, unless I could cry
out a farewell with a great voice over the ruin and make
myself heard.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> been hard at work all yesterday, and besides
had to write a long letter to Bob, so I found no time until
quite late, and then was sleepy. Last night it blew a fearful
gale; I was kept awake about a couple of hours, and
could not get to sleep for the horror of the wind&rsquo;s noise;
the whole house shook; and, mind you, our house is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>150</span>
house, a great castle of jointed stone that would weigh
up a street of English houses; so that when it quakes,
as it did last night, it means something. But the quaking
was not what put me about; it was the horrible howl of
the wind round the corner; the audible haunting of an
incarnate anger about the house; the evil spirit that was
abroad; and, above all, the shuddering silent pauses
when the storm&rsquo;s heart stands dreadfully still for a moment.
O how I hate a storm at night! They have been a great
influence in my life, I am sure; for I can remember them
so far back&mdash;long before I was six at least, for we left the
house in which I remember listening to them times without
number when I was six. And in those days the storm had
for me a perfect impersonation, as durable and unvarying
as any heathen deity. I always heard it, as a horseman
riding past with his cloak about his head, and somehow
always carried away, and riding past again, and being
baffled yet once more, <i>ad infinitum</i>, all night long. I
think I wanted him to get past, but I am not sure; I
know only that I had some interest either for or against
in the matter; and I used to lie and hold my breath,
not quite frightened, but in a state of miserable exaltation.</p>

<p>My first <i>John Knox</i> is in proof, and my second is on
the anvil. It is very good of me so to do; for I want
so much to get to my real tour and my sham tour, the real
tour first; it is always working in my head, and if I can
only turn on the right sort of style at the right moment,
I am not much afraid of it. One thing bothers me; what
with hammering at this J. K., and writing necessary
letters, and taking necessary exercise (that even not
enough, the weather is so repulsive to me, cold and windy),
I find I have no time for reading except times of fatigue,
when I wish merely to relax myself. O&mdash;and I read over
again for this purpose Flaubert&rsquo;s <i>Tentation de St. Antoine</i>;
it struck me a good deal at first, but this second time
it has fetched me immensely. I am but just done with
it, so you will know the large proportion of salt to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>151</span>
with my present statement, that it&rsquo;s the finest thing I
ever read! Of course, it isn&rsquo;t that, it&rsquo;s full of <i>longueurs</i>,

<p>Mr. (later Sir) George Grove was for some years before and after

<p class="rt">[<i>Swanston, Autumn 1874</i>], <i>Thursday.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FRIEND</span>,&mdash;I have another letter from Grove,
about my <i>John Knox</i>, which is flattering in its way: he
is a very gushing and spontaneous person. I am busy
with another Portfolio paper for which I can find no
name; I think I shall require to leave it without.</p>

<p>I am afraid I shall not get to London on my way
to Poland, but I must try to manage it on my way back;
I must see you anyway, before I tackle this sad winter
work, just to get new heart. As it is, I am as jolly as
three, in good health, fairish working trim and on good,
very good, terms with my people.</p>

<p>Look here, I must have people well. If they will keep

horrid day, outside. You talk of my setting to a book,
as if I could; don&rsquo;t you know that things must <i>come</i> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>152</span>
me? I can do but little; I mostly wait and look out. I
am struggling with a Portfolio paper just now, which will
not come straight somehow and <i>will</i> get too gushy; but
a little patience will get it out of the kink and sober it
down I hope. I have been thinking over my movements,
and am not sure but that I may get to London on my way
to Poland after all. Hurrah! But we must not halloo
till we are out of the wood; this may be only a clearing.</p>

<p>God help us all, it is a funny world. To see people
skipping all round us with their eyes sealed up with indifference,
knowing nothing of the earth or man or woman,
going automatically to offices and saying they are happy
or unhappy out of a sense of duty, I suppose, surely at
least from no sense of happiness or unhappiness, unless
perhaps they have a tooth that twinges, is it not like a
bad dream? Why don&rsquo;t they stamp their foot upon the
ground and awake? There is the moon rising in the
east, and there is a person with their heart broken and
still glad and conscious of the world&rsquo;s glory up to the
point of pain; and behold they know nothing of all this!
I should like to kick them into consciousness, for damp
gingerbread puppets as they are. S. C. is down on me
for being bitter; who can help it sometimes, especially
after they have slept ill?</p>

<p>I am going to have a lot of lunch presently; and then
I shall feel all right again, and the loneliness will pass away

I shall send with this two new photographs of myself for

sort of omnibus which is taking him to his hotel.&rdquo; Is that
not well said? It came out in a rather pleasant and
entirely amicable discussion which we had this afternoon
on a walk. The colouring of the world, to-day is of
course hideous; we saw only one pleasant sight, a couple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>153</span>
of lovers under a thorn-tree by the wayside, he with his
arm about her waist: they did not seem to find it so cold
as we. I have made a lot of progress to-day with my

owing to that, or to the fact that I had spent the evening
before in comparatively riotous living, I managed to work
five hours and a half well and without fatigue; besides
reading about an hour more at history. This is a thing
to be proud of.</p>

<p>We have had lately some of the most beautiful sunsets;
our autumn sunsets here are always admirable in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>154</span>
colour. To-night there was just a little lake of tarnished
green deepening into a blood-orange at the margins,
framed above by dark clouds and below by the long roof-line
of the Egyptian buildings on what we call the Mound,
the statues on the top (of her Britannic Majesty and
diverse nondescript Sphinxes) printing themselves off
black against the lit space.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;It has been colder than ever; and to-night
there is a truculent wind about the house, shaking the
windows and making a hollow inarticulate grumbling in
the chimney. I cannot say how much I hate the cold.
It makes my scalp so tight across my head and gives me
such a beastly rheumatism about my shoulders, and
wrinkles and stiffens my face; O I have such a <i>Sehnsucht</i>
for Mentone, where the sun is shining and the air still,
and (a friend writes to me) people are complaining of
the heat.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;I was chased out by my lamp again last
night; it always goes out when I feel in the humour to
write to you. To-day I have been to Church, which has
not improved my temper I must own. The clergyman
did his best to make me hate him, and I took refuge in
that admirable poem the Song of Deborah and Barak;
I should like to make a long scroll of painting (say to go
all round a cornice) illustrative of this poem; with the
people seen in the distance going stealthily on footpaths
while the great highways go vacant; with the archers
besetting the draw-wells; with the princes in hiding on
the hills among the bleating sheep-flocks; with the overthrow
of Sisera, the stars fighting against him in their
courses and that ancient river, the river Kishon, sweeping
him away in anger; with his mother looking and
looking down the long road in the red sunset, and never
a banner and never a spear-clump coming into sight, and
her women with white faces round her, ready with lying
comfort. To say nothing of the people on white asses.</p>

<p>O, I do hate this damned life that I lead. Work&mdash;work&mdash;work;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>155</span>
that&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s amusing; but I want
women about me and I want pleasure. John Knox had
a better time of it than I, with his godly females all leaving
their husbands to follow after him; I would I were
John Knox; I hate living like a hermit. Write me a
nice letter if ever you are in the humour to write to me,
and it doesn&rsquo;t hurt your head. Good-bye.&mdash;Ever your
faithful friend,</p>

<p>The projected visit to his Russian friend in Poland did not come
off, and shortly after the preceding letter Stevenson went for a few
days&rsquo; walking tour in the Chiltern Hills of Buckinghamshire, as
recorded in his essay <i>An Autumn Effect</i>. He then came on for a
visit to London.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>London, November 1874.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="sc">When</span> I left you I found an organ-grinder in Russell
Square playing to a child; and the simple fact that there
was a child listening to him, that he was giving this
pleasure, entitled him, according to my theory, as you
know, to some money; so I put some coppers on the ledge
of his organ, without so much as looking at him, and I
was going on when a woman said to me: &ldquo;Yes, sir, he
do look bad, don&rsquo;t he? scarcely fit like to be working.&rdquo;
And then I looked at the man, and O! he was so ill, so
yellow and heavy-eyed and drooping. I did not like to
go back somehow, and so I gave the woman a shilling
and asked her to give it to him for me. I saw her do so
and walked on; but the face followed me, and so when I
had got to the end of the division, I turned and came
back as hard as I could and filled his hand with money&mdash;ten
to thirteen shillings, I should think. I was sure he
was going to be ill, you know, and he was a young man;
and I dare say he was alone, and had no one to love him.</p>

<p>I had my reward; for a few yards farther on, here was
another organ-grinder playing a dance tune, and perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>156</span>
a dozen children all dancing merrily to his music, singly,
and by twos and threes, and in pretty little figures together.
Just what my organ-grinder in my story wanted
to have happen to him! It was so gay and pleasant in
the twilight under the street lamp.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I was</span> never more sorry to leave you, but I never left
you with a better heart, than last night. I had a long
journey and a cold one; but never was sick nor sorry
the whole way. It was a long one because when we got to
Berwick, we had to go round through the hills by Kelso,
as there was a block on the main line. I knew nothing
of this, and you may imagine my bewilderment when I
came to myself, the train standing and whistling dismally
in the black morning, before a little vacant half-lit station,
with a name up that I had never heard before. My fellow-traveller
woke up and wanted to know what was wrong.
&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;nothing at all, it&rsquo;s an evil
dream.&rdquo; However we had the thing explained to us at
the end of ends, and trailed on in the dark among the
snowy hills, stopping every now and again and whistling
in an appealing kind of way, as much as to say, &ldquo;God
knows where we are, for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t run into us&ldquo;;
until at last we came to a dead standstill and remained so
for perhaps an hour and a quarter. This wakened us up
for a little; and we managed, at last, to attract the
attention of one of the officials whom we could see picking
their way about the snow with lanterns. This man
(very wide awake, and hale, and lusty) informed us we
were waiting for another conductor, as our own guard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>157</span>
did not know the line. &ldquo;Where is the new guard coming
from?&rdquo; we ask. &ldquo;O, close by; only&mdash;he, he&mdash;he was
married last night.&rdquo; And immediately we heard much
hoarse laughter in the dark about us; and the moving
lanterns were shaken to and fro, as if in a wind. This
poor conductor! However, I recomposed myself for
slumber, and did not re-awake much before Edinburgh,
where I was discharged three hours too late and found
my father waiting for me in the snow, with a very long
face.&mdash;Ever your faithful friend,</p>

four complete sets out of it for setting, quite admirable:
the others are not quite one&rsquo;s taste; I find the colour far

<p><span class="sc">Well</span>, I&rsquo;ve got some women now, and they&rsquo;re better
than nothing. Three, without heads, who have been
away getting framed. And you know they are more to
me, after a fashion, than they can be to you, because,
after a fashion also, they are women. I have come now
to think the sitting figure in spite of its beautiful drapery
rather a blemish, rather an interruption to the sentiment.
The two others are better than one has ever dreamed;
I think these two women are the only things in the world
that have been better than, in Bible phrase, it had entered
into my heart to conceive. Who made them? Was it
Pheidias? or do they not know? It is wonderful what
company they are&mdash;noble company. And then I have
now three Japanese pictures that are after my own heart,
and I get up from time to time and turn a bit of favourite
colour over and over, roll it under my tongue, savour it
till it gets all through me; and then back to my chair
and to work.</p>

<p>This afternoon about six there was a small orange
moon, lost in a great world of blue evening. A few leafless
boughs, and a bit of garden railing, criss-cross its
face; and below it there was blueness and the spread
lights of Leith, lost in blue haze. To the east, the town,
also subdued to the same blue, piled itself up, with here
and there a lit window, until it could print off its outline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>159</span>
against a faint patch of green and russet that remained
behind the sunset.</p>

<p>I must tell you about my way of life, which is regular
to a degree. Breakfast 8.30; during breakfast and my
smoke afterwards till ten, when I begin work, I read
Reformation; from ten, I work until about a quarter to
one; from one until two, I lunch and read a book on
Schopenhauer or one on Positivism; two to three work,
three to six anything; if I am in before six, I read about
Japan: six, dinner and a pipe with my father and coffee
until 7.30; 7.30 to 9.30, work; after that either supper
and a pipe at home, or out to Simpson&rsquo;s or Baxter&rsquo;s:
bed between eleven and twelve.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Two good things have arrived to me
to-day: your letter for one, and the end of <i>John Knox</i> for
another. I cannot write English because I have been
speaking French all evening with some French people of
my knowledge. It&rsquo;s a sad thing the state I get into, when
I cannot remember English and yet do not know French!
And it is worse when it is complicated, as at present,
with a pen that will not write! If you knew how I have
to paint and how I have to man&oelig;uvre to get the stuff
legible at all.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I have said the Fates are only women
after a fashion; and that is one of the strangest things
about them. They are wonderfully womanly&mdash;they are
more womanly than any woman&mdash;and those girt draperies
are drawn over a wonderful greatness of body instinct
with sex; I do not see a line in them that could be a
line in a man. And yet, when all is said, they are not
women for us; they are of another race, immortal, separate;
one has no wish to look at them with love, only
with a sort of lowly adoration, physical, but wanting
what is the soul of all love, whether admitted to oneself
or not, hope; in a word &ldquo;the desire of the moth for the
star.&rdquo; O great white stars of eternal marble, O shapely,
colossal women, and yet not women. It is not love that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>160</span>
we seek from them, we do not desire to see their great eyes
troubled with our passions, or the great impassive members
contorted by any hope or pain or pleasure; only
now and again, to be conscious that they exist, to have
knowledge of them far off in cloudland or feel their steady
eyes shining, like quiet watchful stars, above the turmoil
of the earth.</p>

<p>I write so ill; so cheap and miserable and penny-a-linerish
is this <i>John Knox</i> that I have just sent, that I am
low. Only I keep my heart up by thinking of you. And
if all goes to the worst, shall I not be able to lay my
head on the great knees of the middle Fate&mdash;O these
great knees&mdash;I know all Baudelaire meant now with his
<i>géante</i>&mdash;to lay my head on her great knees and go
to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I have finished <i>The Story of King Matthias&rsquo;
Hunting Horn</i>, whereof I spoke to you, and I think it
should be good. It excites me like wine, or fire, or death,
or love, or something; nothing of my own writing ever
excited me so much; it does seem to me so weird and
fantastic.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;I know now that there is a more subtle
and dangerous sort of selfishness in habit than there ever
can be in disorder. I never ceased to be generous when
I was most <i>déréglé</i>; now when I am beginning to settle
into habits, I see the danger in front of me&mdash;one might
cease to be generous and grow hard and sordid in time
and trouble. However, thank God it is life I want, and
nothing posthumous, and for two good emotions I would
sacrifice a thousand years of fame. Moreover I know so
well that I shall never be much as a writer that I am not
very sorely tempted.</p>

<p>My only chance is in my stories; and so you will forgive
me if I postpone everything else to copy out <i>King
Matthias</i>; I have learned by experience that a story
should be copied out and finished fairly off at the first
heat if ever. I am even thinking of finishing up half-a-dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>161</span>
perhaps and trying the publishers? what do you
say? Give me your advice?</p>

to tell it: well and happy. Adieu.&mdash;Ever your faithful
friend,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To Mrs. Sitwell</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Edinburgh</i> [<i>Sunday, November 1874</i>].</p>

<p><span class="sc">Here</span> is my long story: yesterday night, after having
supped, I grew so restless that I was obliged to go out
in search of some excitement. There was a half-moon
lying over on its back, and incredibly bright in the midst
of a faint grey sky set with faint stars: a very inartistic
moon, that would have damned a picture.</p>

<p>At the most populous place of the city I found a little
boy, three years old perhaps, half frantic with terror, and
crying to every one for his &ldquo;Mammy.&rdquo; This was about
eleven, mark you. People stopped and spoke to him, and
then went on, leaving him more frightened than before.
But I and a good-humoured mechanic came up together;
and I instantly developed a latent faculty for setting the
hearts of children at rest. Master Tommy Murphy (such
was his name) soon stopped crying, and allowed me to
take him up and carry him; and the mechanic and I
trudged away along Princes Street to find his parents.
I was soon so tired that I had to ask the mechanic to
carry the bairn; and you should have seen the puzzled
contempt with which he looked at me, for knocking in
so soon. He was a good fellow, however, although very
impracticable and sentimental; and he soon bethought
him that Master Murphy might catch cold after his excitement,
so we wrapped him up in my greatcoat. &ldquo;Tobauga
(Tobago) Street&rdquo; was the address he gave us; and we
deposited him in a little grocer&rsquo;s shop and went through
all the houses in the street without being able to find
any one of the name of Murphy. Then I set off to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>162</span>
head police office, leaving my greatcoat in pawn about
Master Murphy&rsquo;s person. As I went down one of the
lowest streets in the town, I saw a little bit of life that
struck me. It was now half-past twelve, a little shop
stood still half-open, and a boy of four or five years old
was walking up and down before it imitating cockcrow.
He was the only living creature within sight.</p>

<p>At the police offices no word of Master Murphy&rsquo;s
parents; so I went back empty-handed. The good
groceress, who had kept her shop open all this time, could
keep the child no longer; her father, bad with bronchitis,
said he must forth. So I got a large scone with currants
in it, wrapped my coat about Tommy, got him up on my
arm, and away to the police office with him: not very
easy in my mind, for the poor child, young as he was&mdash;he
could scarce speak&mdash;was full of terror for the &ldquo;office,&rdquo;
as he called it. He was now very grave and quiet and
communicative with me; told me how his father thrashed
him, and divers household matters. Whenever he saw a
woman on our way he looked after her over my shoulder
and then gave his judgment: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no <i>her</i>,&rdquo; adding
sometimes, &ldquo;She has a wean wi&rsquo; her.&rdquo; Meantime I was
telling him how I was going to take him to a gentleman
who would find out his mother for him quicker than ever
I could, and how he must not be afraid of him, but be
brave, as he had been with me. We had just arrived at
our destination&mdash;we were just under the lamp&mdash;when he
looked me in the face and said appealingly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll no put
me in the office?&rdquo; And I had to assure him that he
would not, even as I pushed open the door and took him in.</p>

<p>The serjeant was very nice, and I got Tommy comfortably
seated on a bench, and spirited him up with good
words and the scone with the currants in it; and then,
telling him I was just going out to look for Mammy, I
got my greatcoat and slipped away.</p>

<p>Poor little boy! he was not called for, I learn, until ten
this morning. This is very ill written, and I&rsquo;ve missed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>163</span>
half that was picturesque in it; but to say truth, I am
very tired and sleepy: it was two before I got to bed.
However, you see, I had my excitement.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;I have written nothing all morning; I cannot
settle to it. Yes&mdash;I <i>will</i> though.</p>

<p>10.45.&mdash;And I did. I want to say something more to
you about the three women. I wonder so much why
they should have been <i>women</i>, and halt between two
opinions in the matter. Sometimes I think it is because
they were made by a man for men; sometimes, again,
I think there is an abstract reason for it, and there is
something more substantive about a woman than ever
there can be about a man. I can conceive a great
mythical woman, living alone among inaccessible mountain-tops
or in some lost island in the pagan seas, and
ask no more. Whereas if I hear of a Hercules, I ask after
Iole or Dejanira. I cannot think him a man without
women. But I can think of these three deep-breasted
women, living out all their days on remote hilltops, seeing
the white dawn and the purple even, and the world
outspread before them for ever, and no more to them
for ever than a sight of the eyes, a hearing of the ears, a
far-away interest of the inflexible heart, not pausing, not
pitying, but austere with a holy austerity, rigid with a
calm and passionless rigidity; and I find them none the
less women to the end.</p>

<p>And think, if one could love a woman like that once,
see her once grow pale with passion, and once wring your
lips out upon hers, would it not be a small thing to die?
Not that there is not a passion of a quite other sort, much
less epic, far more dramatic and intimate, that comes
out of the very frailty of perishable women; out of the
lines of suffering that we see written about their eyes,
and that we may wipe out if it were but for a moment;
out of the thin hands, wrought and tempered in agony
to a fineness of perception, that the indifferent or the
merely happy cannot know; out of the tragedy that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>164</span>
lies about such a love, and the pathetic incompleteness.
This is another thing, and perhaps it is a higher. I look
over my shoulder at the three great headless Madonnas,
and they look back at me and do not move; see me, and
through and over me, the foul life of the city dying to
its embers already as the night draws on; and over miles
and miles of silent country, set here and there with lit
towns, thundered through here and there with night
expresses scattering fire and smoke; and away to the
ends of the earth, and the furthest star, and the blank
regions of nothing; and they are not moved. My quiet,
great-kneed, deep-breasted, well-draped ladies of Necessity,
I give my heart to you!</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;I have come from a concert, and the concert
was rather a disappointment. Not so my afternoon
skating&mdash;Duddingston, our big loch, is bearing; and I
wish you could have seen it this afternoon, covered with
people, in thin driving snow flurries, the big hill
grim and white and alpine overhead in the thick
air, and the road up the gorge, as it were into the
heart of it, dotted black with traffic. Moreover, I
<i>can</i> skate a little bit; and what one can do is always
pleasant to do.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I got your letter to-day, and was so glad
thereof. It was of good omen to me also. I worked
from ten to one (my classes are suspended now for Xmas
holidays), and wrote four or five Portfolio pages of my
Buckinghamshire affair. Then I went to Duddingston
and skated all afternoon. If you had seen the moon
rising, a perfect sphere of smoky gold, in the dark air
above the trees, and the white loch thick with skaters,
and the great hill, snow-sprinkled, overhead! It was a
sight for a king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>165</span></p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I stayed on Duddingston to-day till after
nightfall. The little booths that hucksters set up round
the edge were marked each one by its little lamp. There
were some fires too; and the light, and the shadows
of the people who stood round them to warm themselves,
made a strange pattern all round on the snow-covered ice.
A few people with torches began to travel up and down
the ice, a lit circle travelling along with them over the
snow. A gigantic moon rose, meanwhile, over the trees
and the kirk on the promontory among perturbed and
vacillating clouds.</p>

<p>The walk home was very solemn and strange. Once,
through a broken gorge, we had a glimpse of a little
space of mackerel sky, moon-litten, on the other side
of the hill; the broken ridges standing grey and spectral
between; and the hilltop over all, snow-white, and
strangely magnified in size.</p>

<p>This must go to you to-morrow, so that you may
read it on Christmas Day for company. I hope it may be
good company to you.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Outside, it snows thick and steadily. The
gardens before our house are now a wonderful fairy forest.
And O, this whiteness of things, how I love it, how it
sends the blood about my body! Maurice de Guérin
hated snow; what a fool he must have been! Somebody
tried to put me out of conceit with it by
saying that people were lost in it. As if people don&rsquo;t
get lost in love, too, and die of devotion to art;
as if everything worth were not an occasion to some
people&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>What a wintry letter this is! Only I think it is
winter seen from the inside of a warm greatcoat. And
there is, at least, a warm heart about it somewhere. Do
you know, what they say in Xmas stories is true. I
think one loves their friends more dearly at this season.&mdash;Ever

and all that was so pleasant in the past.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Yesterday I wasn&rsquo;t well and to-night I
have been ever so busy. There came a note from the
Academy, sent by John H. Ingram, the editor of the
edition of Poe&rsquo;s works I have been reviewing, challenging
me to find any more faults. I have found nearly
sixty; so I may be happy; but that makes me none the
less sleepy; so I must go to bed.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I am awfully out of the humour to write;
I am very inert although quite happy; I am informed
by those who are more expert that I am bilious. <i>Bien</i>;
let it be so; I am still content; and though I can do no
original work, I get forward making notes for my Knox
at a good trot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>167</span></p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;I am so happy. I am no longer here in
Edinburgh. I have been all yesterday evening and this
forenoon in Italy, four hundred years ago, with one
Sannazzaro, a sculptor, painter, poet, etc., and one
Ippolita, a beautiful Duchess. O I like it badly! I
wish you could hear it at once; or rather I wish you
could see it immediately in beautiful type on such a
page as it ought to be, in my first little volume of stories.
What a change this is from collecting dull notes for
<i>John Knox</i>, as I have been all the early part of the week&mdash;the
difference between life and death.&mdash;I am quite well
again and in such happy spirits, as who would not be,
having spent so much of his time at that convent on
the hills with these sweet people. <i>Vous verrez</i>, and if
you don&rsquo;t like this story&mdash;well, I give it up if you don&rsquo;t
like it. Not but what there&rsquo;s a long way to travel yet;
I am no farther than the threshold; I have only set the
men, and the game has still to be played, and a lot of dim
notions must become definite and shapely, and a deal be
clear to me that is anything but clear as yet. The story
shall be called, I think, <i>When the Devil was well</i>, in allusion
to the old proverb.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I have worked too hard; I have
given myself one day of rest, and that was not enough;
so I am giving myself another. I shall go to bed again

this wrongly; I wish you could come; and I do not
know anything that would make me happier, but I see
that it is wrong to expect it, and so I resign myself: some
time after. I offered Appleton a series of papers on the
modern French school&mdash;the Parnassiens, I think they call
them&mdash;de Banville, Coppée, Soulary, and Sully Prudhomme.
But he has not deigned to answer my
letter.</p>

<p>I shall have another Portfolio paper so soon as I am
done with this story, that has played me out; the story
is to be called <i>When the Devil was well</i>: scene, Italy,
Renaissance; colour, purely imaginary of course, my
own unregenerate idea of what Italy then was. O, when
shall I find the story of my dreams, that shall never halt
nor wander nor step aside, but go ever before its face,
and ever swifter and louder, until the pit receives it,
roaring? The Portfolio paper will be about Scotland and
England.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p><span class="sc">I wish</span> I could write better letters to you. Mine must
be very dull. I must try to give you news. Well, I was
at the annual dinner of my old Academy schoolfellows
last night. We sat down ten, out of seventy-two! The
others are scattered all over the places of the earth, some
in San Francisco, some in New Zealand, some in India,
one in the backwoods&mdash;it gave one a wide look over the
world to hear them talk so. I read them some verses.
It is great fun; I always read verses, and in the vinous
enthusiasm of the moment they always propose to have
them printed; <i>Ce qui n&rsquo;arrive jamais du reste</i>: in the
morning, they are more calm.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;It occurs to me that one reason why there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>169</span>
no news in my letters is because there is so little in my
life. I always tell you of my concerts: I was at another
yesterday afternoon: a recital of Hallé and Norman
Neruda. I went in the evening to the pantomime with
the Mackintoshes&mdash;cousins of mine. Their little boy,
aged four, was there for the first time. To see him with
his eyes fixed and open like saucers, and never varying
his expression save in so far as he might sometimes open
his mouth a little wider, was worth the money. He
laughed only once&mdash;when the giant&rsquo;s dwarf fed his master
as though he were a child. Coming home, he was much
interested as to who made the fairies, and wanted to
know if they were like <i>berries</i>. I should like to know
how much this question was due to the idea of their
coming up from under the stage, and how much to a
vague idea of rhyme. When he was told that they were
not like berries, he then asked if they had not been flowers
before they were fairies. It was a good deal in the vein
of Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s primitive man all this.</p>

<p>I am pretty well but have not got back to work much

more perhaps than is wholesome. I have only been two

am shaking badly, as you can see in my handwriting, and
my back is a bit bad. They give me pleasure though, quite

perhaps; but I should also get more notice, should
I not? and so, do better for myself in the long run. Now,
should I not? Besides a book with boards is a book

<p><span class="sc">I got</span> your nice long gossiping letter to-day&mdash;I mean
by that that there was more news in it than usual&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>172</span>
so, of course, I am pretty jolly. I am in the house, however,
with such a beastly cold in the head. Our east
winds begin already to be very cold.</p>

<p>O, I have such a longing for children of my own; and
yet I do not think I could bear it if I had one. I fancy
I must feel more like a woman than like a man about
that. I sometimes hate the children I see on the street&mdash;you
know what I mean by hate&mdash;wish they were somewhere
else, and not there to mock me; and sometimes,
again, I don&rsquo;t know how to go by them for the love of
them, especially the very wee ones.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I have been still in the house since I wrote,
and I <i>have</i> worked. I finished the Italian story; not well,
but as well as I can just now; I must go all over it again,
some time soon, when I feel in the humour to better and
perfect it. And now I have taken up an old story, begun
years ago; and I have now re-written all I had written
of it then, and mean to finish it. What I have lost and
gained is odd. As far as regards simple writing, of course,
I am in another world now; but in some things, though
more clumsy, I seem to have been freer and more plucky:
this is a lesson I have taken to heart. I have got a jolly
new name for my old story. I am going to call it <i>A Country
Dance</i>; the two heroes keep changing places, you know;
and the chapter where the most of this changing goes
on is to be called &ldquo;Up the middle, down the middle.&rdquo;
It will be in six or (perhaps) seven chapters. I have
never worked harder in my life than these last four days.
If I can only keep it up.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Yesterday, Leslie Stephen, who was down
here to lecture, called on me and took me up to see a
poor fellow, a sort of poet who writes for him, and
who has been eighteen months in our infirmary, and
may be, for all I know, eighteen months more. It was
very sad to see him there, in a little room with two beds,
and a couple of sick children in the other bed; a girl
came in to visit the children, and played dominoes on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>173</span>
the counterpane with them; the gas flared and crackled,
the fire burned in a dull economical way; Stephen and
I sat on a couple of chairs, and the poor fellow sat up
in his bed with his hair and beard all tangled, and talked
as cheerfully as if he had been in a King&rsquo;s palace, or the
great King&rsquo;s palace of the blue air. He has taught himself
two languages since he has been lying there. I shall
try to be of use to him.</p>

windy withal, and the sun hot. I dreamed last night I

my heart very cool and happy.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

to carry him down the long stair, and more of a business
to get him up again, but while he was in the carriage it
was splendid. It is now just the top of spring with us.
The whole country is mad with green. To see the cherry-blossom
bitten out upon the black firs, and the black firs
bitten out of the blue sky, was a sight to set before a king.
You may imagine what it was to a man who has been
eighteen months in an hospital ward. The look of his
face was a wine to me. He plainly has been little in
the country before. Imagine this: I always stopped him
on the Bridges to let him enjoy the great <i>cry</i> of green that
goes up to Heaven out of the river beds, and he asked
(more than once) &ldquo;What noise is that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The water.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;O!&rdquo;
almost incredulously; and then quite a long
while after: &ldquo;Do you know the noise of the water
astonished me very much?&rdquo; I was much struck by his
putting the question <i>twice</i>; I have lost the sense of
wonder of course; but there must be something to wonder
at, for Henley has eyes and ears and an immortal soul
of his own.</p>

other chalky banks with very complicated footpaths, oak
woods, a field where a man stands reaping, church towers
relieved against the sky and a beautiful distance, neither
blue nor green. It is so still, the light is so cool and
temperate, the river woos you to bathe in it. O I like it!</p>

<p>I say, I wonder if our Scottish Academy&rsquo;s exhibition
is going to be done at all for Appleton or whether he does
not care for it. It might amuse me, although I am not
fit for it. Why and O why doesn&rsquo;t Grove publish me?&mdash;Ever

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I am a devil certainly; but write
I cannot. Look here, you had better get hold of G. C.
Lichtenberg&rsquo;s <i>Ausfürliche Erklarung der Hogarthischen
Kupferstiche</i>: Göttingen, 1794 to 1816 (it was published
in numbers seemingly). Douglas the publisher lent it to
me: and tho&rsquo; I hate the damned tongue too cordially to
do more than dip into it, I have seen some shrewd things.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>179</span>
If you cannot get it for yourself, (it seems scarce), I dare
say I could negotiate with Douglas for a loan. This
adorable spring has made me quite drunken, drunken
with green colour and golden sound. We have the best
blackbird here that we have had for years; we have two;
but the other is but an average performer. Anything so
rich and clear as the pipe of our first fiddle, it never entered
into the heart of man to fancy. How the years slip away,
Colvin; and we walk little cycles, and turn in little abortive
spirals, and come out again, hot and weary, to find
the same view before us, the same hill barring the road.
Only, bless God for it, we have still the same eye to see
with, and if the scene be not altogether unsightly, we
can enjoy it whether or no. I feel quite happy, but
curiously inert and passive, something for the winds to
blow over, and the sun to glimpse on and go off again, as
it might be a tree or a gravestone. All this willing and
wishing and striving leads a man nowhere after all. Here
I am back again in my old humour of a sunny equanimity;
to see the world fleet about me; and the days chase each
other like sun patches, and the nights like cloud-shadows,
on a windy day; content to see them go and no wise
reluctant for the cool evening, with its dew and stars and
fading strain of tragic red. And I ask myself why
I ever leave this humour? What I have gained?
And the winds blow in the trees with a sustained
&ldquo;Pish&ldquo;! and the birds answer me in a long derisive
whistle.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>15 Waterloo Place, S. W., 15/5/74</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;I have read with great interest your article on Victor
Hugo and also that which appeared in the last number of Macmillan.
I shall be happy to accept Hugo, and if I have been rather
long in answering you, it is only because I wished to give a second
reading to the article, and have lately been very much interrupted.</p>

<p>I will now venture to make a few remarks, and by way of
preface I must say that I do not criticise you because I take a low
view of your powers: but for the very contrary reason. I think
very highly of the promise shown in your writings and therefore
think it worth while to write more fully than I can often to contributors.
Nor do I set myself up as a judge&mdash;I am very sensible
of my own failings in the critical department and merely submit
what has occurred to me for your consideration.</p>

<p>I fully agree with the greatest portion of your opinions and
think them very favourably expressed. The following points
struck me as doubtful when I read and may perhaps be worth
notice.</p>

<p>First, you seem to make the distinction between dramatic and
novelistic art coincide with the distinction between romantic and
18th century. This strikes me as doubtful, as at least to
require qualification. To my mind Hugo is far more dramatic in
spirit than Fielding, though his method involves (as you show
exceedingly well) a use of scenery and background which would
hardly be admissible in drama. I am not able&mdash;I fairly confess&mdash;to
define the dramatic element in Hugo or to say why I think it
absent from Fielding and Richardson. Yet surely Hugo&rsquo;s own
dramas are a sufficient proof that a drama may be romantic as well
as a novel: though, of course, the pressure of the great moral
forces, etc., must be indicated by different means. The question is
rather a curious one and too wide to discuss in a letter. I merely
suggest what seems to me to be an obvious criticism on your
argument.</p>

<p>Secondly, you speak very sensibly of the melodramatic and
clap-trap element in Hugo. I confess that it seems to me to go
deeper into his work than you would apparently allow. I think it,
for example, very palpable even in <i>Notre Dame</i>, and I doubt the
historical fidelity though my ignorance of mediæval history prevents
me from putting my finger on many faults. The consequence
is that in my opinion you are scarcely just to Scott or Fielding as
compared with Hugo. Granting fully his amazing force and fire,
he seems to me to be deficient often in that kind of healthy realism
which is so admirable in Scott&rsquo;s best work. For example, though
my Scotch blood (for I can boast of some) may prejudice me I am
profoundly convinced that Balfour of Burley would have knocked
M. Lantenac into a cocked hat and stormed la Tourgue if it had
been garrisoned by 19 x 19 French spouters of platitude in half
the time that Gauvain and Cimourdain took about it. In fact,
Balfour seems to me to be flesh and blood and Gauvain &amp; Co. to
be too often mere personified bombast: and therefore I fancy
that <i>Old Mortality</i> will outlast &rsquo;93, though <i>Notre Dame</i> is far better
than <i>Quentin Durward</i>, and <i>Les Misérables</i>, perhaps, better than
any. This is, of course, fair matter of opinion.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I don&rsquo;t think that you quite bring out your meaning in
saying that &rsquo;93 is a decisive symptom. I confess that I don&rsquo;t quite
see in what sense it decides precisely what question. A sentence or
so would clear this up.</p>

<p>Fourthly, as a matter of form, I think (but I am very doubtful)
that it might possibly have been better not to go into each novel
in succession; but to group the substance of your remarks a little
differently. Of course I don&rsquo;t want you to alter the form, I merely
notice the point as suggesting a point in regard to any future
article.</p>

<p>Many of your criticisms in detail strike me as very good. I was
much pleased by your remarks on the storm in the <i>Travailleurs</i>.
There was another very odd storm, as it struck me on a hasty
reading in &rsquo;93, where there is mention of a beautiful summer evening
and yet the wind is so high that you can&rsquo;t hear the tocsin.
You do justice also and more than justice to Hugo&rsquo;s tenderness
about children. That, I think, points to one great source of his
power.</p>

<p>It would be curious to compare Hugo to a much smaller man,
Chas. Reade, who is often a kind of provincial or Daily Telegraph
Hugo. However that would hardly do in the Cornhill. I shall
send your article to the press and hope to use it in July. Any
alterations can be made when the article is in type, if any are
desirable. I cannot promise definitely in advance; but at any
rate it shall appear as soon as may be.</p>

<p>Excuse this long rigmarole and believe me to be, yours very
truly,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Leslie Stephen.</p>

<p>I shall hope to hear from you again. If ever you come to town
you will find me at 8 Southwell Gardens (close to the Gloucester
Road Station of the Underground). I am generally at home,
except from 3 to 5.</p>

<h3>ADVOCATE AND AUTHOR</h3>

<h5>EDINBURGH&mdash;PARIS&mdash;FONTAINEBLEAU</h5>

<h6><span class="sc">July 1875-July 1879</span></h6>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Having</span> on the 14th of July 1875 passed with credit his
examination for the Bar at Edinburgh, Stevenson thenceforth
enjoyed whatever status and consideration attaches
to the title of Advocate. But he made no serious attempt
to practise, and by the 25th of the same month had started
with Sir Walter Simpson for France. Here he lived and
tramped for several weeks among the artist haunts of
Fontainebleau and the neighbourhood, occupying himself
chiefly with studies of the French poets and poetry of the
fifteenth century, which afterwards bore fruit in his papers
on Charles of Orleans and François Villon. Thence he
travelled to join his parents at Wiesbaden and Homburg.
Returning in the autumn to Scotland, he made, to please
them, an effort to live the ordinary life of an Edinburgh
advocate&mdash;attending trials and spending his mornings in
wig and gown at the Parliament House. But this attempt
was before long abandoned as tending to waste of time
and being incompatible with his real occupation of literature.
Through the next winter and spring he remained
in Edinburgh, except for a short winter walking tour in
Ayrshire and Galloway, and a month spent among his
friends in London. In the late summer of 1876, after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>183</span>
visit to the West Highlands, he made the canoe trip with
Sir Walter Simpson which furnished the subject of the
<i>Inland Voyage</i>, followed by a prolonged autumn stay at
Grez and Barbizon. The life, atmosphere, and scenery
of these forest haunts had charmed and soothed him,
as we have seen, since he was first introduced to them
by his cousin, Mr. R. A. M. Stevenson, in the spring of
1875. An unfettered, unconventional, open-air existence,
passed face to face with nature and in the company of
congenial people engaged, like himself, in grappling with
the problems and difficulties of an art, had been what
he had longed for most consistently through all the
agitations of his youth. And now he had found just
such an existence, and with it, as he thought, peace of
mind, health, and the spirit of unimpeded work.</p>

<p>But peace of mind was not to be his for long. What
indeed awaited him in the forest was something different
and more momentous: it was his fate: the romance
which decided his life, and the companion whom he resolved
to make his own at all hazards. But of this hereafter.
To continue briefly the annals of the time: the
year 1877 was again spent between Edinburgh, London,
the Fontainebleau region, and several different temporary
abodes in the artists&rsquo; and other quarters of Paris; with
an excursion in the company of his parents to the Land&rsquo;s
End in August. In 1878 a similar general mode of life
was varied by a visit with his parents in March to Burford
Bridge, where he made warm friends with a senior
to whom he had long looked up from a distance, Mr.
George Meredith; by a spell of secretarial work under
Professor Fleeming Jenkin, who was serving as a juror
on the Paris Exhibition; and lastly, by the autumn
tramp through the Cévennes, afterwards recounted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>184</span>
so much charm in <i>Travels with a Donkey</i>. The first half
of 1879 was again spent between London, Scotland, and
France.</p>

<p>During these four years, it should be added, Stevenson&rsquo;s
health was very passable. It often, indeed, threatened
to give way after any prolonged residence in Edinburgh,
but was generally soon restored by open-air excursions
(during which he was capable of fairly vigorous and
sustained daily exercise), or by a spell of life among the
woods of Fontainebleau. They were also the years in
which he settled for good into his chosen profession of
letters. He worked rather desultorily for the first twelve
months after his call to the Bar, but afterwards with ever-growing
industry and success, winning from the critical
a full measure of recognition, though relatively little, so
far, from the general public. In 1875 and 1876 he contributed
as a journalist, though not frequently, to the
Academy and Vanity Fair, and in 1877 more abundantly
to London, a weekly review founded by Mr. Glasgow
Brown, an acquaintance of Edinburgh Speculative days,
and carried on, after the failure of that gentleman&rsquo;s health,
by Mr. Henley. But he had no great gift or liking for
journalism, or for any work not calling for the best literary
form and finish he could give. Where he found special
scope for such work was in the Cornhill Magazine under
the editorship of Mr. Leslie Stephen. Here he continued
his critical papers on men and books, already begun in
1874 with <i>Victor Hugo</i>, and began in 1876 the series of
papers afterwards collected in <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i>. They
were continued in 1877, and in greater number throughout
1878. His first published stories appeared as follows:&mdash;<i>A
Lodging for the Night</i>, Temple Bar, October 1877; <i>The
Sire de Malétroit&rsquo;s Door</i>, Temple Bar, January 1878; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>185</span>
<i>Will o&rsquo; the Mill</i>, Cornhill Magazine, January 1878. In
May 1878 followed his first travel book, <i>The Inland Voyage</i>,
containing the account of his canoe trip from Antwerp
to Grez. This was to Stevenson a year of great and
various productiveness. Besides six or eight characteristic
essays of the <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i> series, there
appeared in London the set of fantastic modern tales
called the <i>New Arabian Nights</i>, conceived and written
in an entirely different key from any of his previous work,
as well as the kindly, sentimental comedy of French
artist life, <i>Providence and the Guitar</i>; and in the Portfolio
the <i>Picturesque Notes on Edinburgh</i>, republished at
the end of the year in book form. During the autumn
and winter of this year he wrote <i>Travels with a Donkey
in the Cévennes</i>, and was much and eagerly engaged in the
planning of plays in collaboration with Mr. Henley; of
which one, <i>Deacon Brodie</i>, was finished in the spring of
1879. In the same spring he drafted in Edinburgh, but
afterwards laid by, four chapters on ethics, a study of
which he once spoke as being always his &ldquo;veiled mistress,&rdquo;
under the name of <i>Lay Morals</i>.</p>

<p>But abounding in good work as this period was, and
momentous as it was in regard to Stevenson&rsquo;s future
life, it is a period which figures but meagrely in his correspondence,
and in this book must fill disproportionately
little space. Without the least breach of friendship, or
even of intimate confidence on occasion, Stevenson had
begun, as was natural and necessary, to wean himself from
his entire dependence on his friend and counsellor of the
last two years; to take his life more into his own hands;
and to intermit the regularity of his correspondence with
her. A few new correspondents appear; but to none of
us in these days did he write more than scantily. Partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>186</span>
his growing absorption by the complications of his life
and the interests of his work left him little time or inclination
for letter-writing; partly his greater freedom of
movement made it unnecessary. On his way backwards
and forwards between Scotland and France, his friends
in London had the chance of seeing him much more frequently
than of yore. He avoided formal and dress-coated
society; but in the company of congenial friends,
whether men or women, and in places like the Savile
Club (his favourite haunt), he was as brilliant and stimulating
as ever, and however acute his inward preoccupations,
his visits were always a delight.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Herewith you receive the rest of
Henley&rsquo;s hospital work. He was much pleased by what
you said of him, and asked me to forward these to you
for your opinion. One poem, the <i>Spring Sorrow</i>, seems to
me the most beautiful. I thank God for this <i>petit bout de
consolation</i>, that by Henley&rsquo;s own account, this one more
lovely thing in the world is not altogether without some
trace of my influence: let me say that I have been something
sympathetic which the mother found and contemplated
while she yet carried it in her womb. This, in
my profound discouragement, is a great thing for me; if
I cannot do good with myself, at least, it seems, I can
help others better inspired; I am at least a skilful accoucheur.
My discouragement is from many causes: among
others the re-reading of my Italian story. Forgive me,

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;I have been three days at a place
called Grez, a pretty and very melancholy village on the
plain. A low bridge of many arches choked with sedge;
great fields of white and yellow water-lilies; poplars and
willows innumerable; and about it all such an atmosphere
of sadness and slackness, one could do nothing but get
into the boat and out of it again, and yawn for bedtime.</p>

<p>Yesterday Bob and I walked home; it came on a very
creditable thunderstorm; we were soon wet through;
sometimes the rain was so heavy that one could only see
by holding the hand over the eyes; and to crown all,
we lost our way and wandered all over the place, and into
the artillery range, among broken trees, with big shot
lying about among the rocks. It was near dinner-time
when we got to Barbizon; and it is supposed that we
walked from twenty-three to twenty-five miles, which is
not bad for the Advocate, who is not tired this morning.
I was very glad to be back again in this dear place, and
smell the wet forest in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I have</span> been staying in town, and could not write a
word. It is a fine strong night, full of wind; the trees
are all crying out in the darkness; funny to think of the
birds asleep outside, on the tossing branches, the little
bright eyes closed, the brave wings folded, the little hearts
that beat so hard and thick (so much harder and thicker
than ever human heart) all stilled and quieted in deep
slumber, in the midst of this noise and turmoil. Why,
it will be as much as I can do to sleep in here in my walled
room; so loud and jolly the wind sounds through the open
window. The unknown places of the night invite the
travelling fancy; I like to think of the sleeping towns
and sleeping farm-houses and cottages, all the world over,
here by the white road poplar-lined, there by the clamorous
surf. Isn&rsquo;t that a good dormitive?</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;I cannot tell how I feel, who can ever? I
feel like a person in a novel of George Sand&rsquo;s; I feel I
desire to go out of the house, and begin life anew in the
cool blue night; never to come back here; never, never.
Only to go on for ever by sunny day and grey day, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>190</span>
bright night and foul, by high-way and by-way, town
and hamlet, until somewhere by a road-side or in some
clean inn clean death opened his arms to me and took
me to his quiet heart for ever. If soon, good; if late, well
then, late&mdash;there would be many a long bright mile behind
me, many a goodly, many a serious sight; I should die
ripe and perfect, and take my garnered experience with
me into the cool, sweet earth. For I have died already
and survived a death; I have seen the grass grow rankly
on my grave; I have heard the train of mourners come
weeping and go laughing away again. And when I was
alone there in the kirk-yard, and the birds began to grow
familiar with the grave-stone, I have begun to laugh
also, and laughed and laughed until night-flowers came
out above me. I have survived myself, and somehow
live on, a curious changeling, a merry ghost; and do not
mind living on, finding it not unpleasant; only had
rather, a thousandfold, died and been done with the
whole damned show for ever. It is a strange feeling at
first to survive yourself, but one gets used to that as to
most things. <i>Et puis</i>, is it not one&rsquo;s own fault? Why
did not one lie still in the grave? Why rise again among
men&rsquo;s troubles and toils, where the wicked wag their
shock beards and hound the weary out to labour? When
I was safe in prison, and stone walls and iron bars were
an hermitage about me, who told me to burst the mild
constraint and go forth where the sun dazzles, and the
wind pierces, and the loud world sounds and jangles all
through the weary day? I mind an old print of a hermit
coming out of a great wood towards evening and shading
his bleared eyes to see all the kingdoms of the earth
before his feet, where towered cities and castled hills,
and stately rivers, and good corn lands made one great
chorus of temptation for his weak spirit, and I think I am
the hermit, and would to God I had dwelt ever in the
wood of penitence<a name="FnAnchor_20" href="#Footnote_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The <i>Burns</i> herein mentioned is an article undertaken in the
early summer of the same year for the Encyclopædia Britannica.
In the end Stevenson&rsquo;s work was thought to convey a view of the
poet too frankly critical, and too little in accordance with the
accepted Scotch tradition; and the publishers, duly paying him
for his labours, transferred the task to Professor Shairp. The
volume here announced on the three Scottish eighteenth-century
poets unfortunately never came into being. The <i>Charles of Orleans</i>
essay appeared in the Cornhill Magazine for December of the
following year; that on Villon (with the story on the same theme,
<i>A Lodging for the Night</i>) not until the autumn of 1877. The essay
on Béranger referred to at the end of the letter was one commissioned
and used by the editor of the Encyclopædia; <i>Spring</i> was a
prose poem, of which the manuscript, sent to me at Cambridge,
was unluckily lost in the confusion of a change of rooms.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Edinburgh, Autumn 1875.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Thanks for your letter and news.
No&mdash;my <i>Burns</i> is not done yet, it has led me so far afield
that I cannot finish it; every time I think I see my way
to an end, some new game (or perhaps wild goose) starts
up, and away I go. And then, again, to be plain, I shirk
the work of the critical part, shirk it as a man shirks a
long jump. It is awful to have to express and differentiate
<i>Burns</i> in a column or two. O golly, I say, you know,
it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be done at the money. All the more as I&rsquo;m going
to write a book about it. <i>Ramsay, Fergusson, and Burns:
an Essay</i> (or <i>a critical essay?</i> but then I&rsquo;m going to give
lives of the three gentlemen, only the gist of the book is
the criticism) by Robert Louis Stevenson, Advocate.
How&rsquo;s that for cut and dry? And I <i>could</i> write this
book. Unless I deceive myself, I could even write it
pretty adequately. I feel as if I was really in it, and
knew the game thoroughly. You see what comes of trying
to write an essay on Burns in ten columns.</p>

<p>Meantime, when I have done Burns, I shall finish
Charles of Orleans (who is in a good way, about the fifth
month, I should think, and promises to be a fine healthy
child, better than any of his elder brothers for a while);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>192</span>
and then perhaps a Villon, for Villon is a very essential
part of my <i>Ramsay-Fergusson-Burns</i>; I mean, is a note
in it, and will recur again and again for comparison and
illustration; then, perhaps, I may try Fontainebleau, by
the way. But so soon as Charles of Orleans is polished
off, and immortalised for ever, he and his pipings, in a
solid imperishable shrine of R. L. S., my true aim and
end will be this little book. Suppose I could jerk you out
100 Cornhill pages; that would easy make 200 pages of
decent form; and then thickish paper&mdash;eh? would that
do? I dare say it could be made bigger; but I know
what 100 pages of copy, bright consummate copy, imply
behind the scenes of weary manuscribing; I think if I
put another nothing to it, I should not be outside the
mark; and 100 Cornhill pages of 500 words means, I
fancy (but I never was good at figures), means 50,000
words. There&rsquo;s a prospect for an idle young gentleman
who lives at home at ease! The future is thick with
inky fingers. And then perhaps nobody would publish.
<i>Ah nom de dieu!</i> What do you think of all this? will
it paddle, think you?</p>

<p>I hope this pen will write; it is the third I have tried.</p>

<p>About coming up, no, that&rsquo;s impossible; for I am
worse than a bankrupt. I have at the present six shillings
and a penny; I have a sounding lot of bills for Christmas;
new dress suit, for instance, the old one having
gone for Parliament House; and new white shirts to
live up to my new profession; I&rsquo;m as gay and swell and
gummy as can be; only all my boots leak; one pair
water, and the other two simple black mud; so that
my rig is more for the eye than a very solid comfort to
myself. That is my budget. Dismal enough, and no
prospect of any coin coming in; at least for months. So
that here I am, I almost fear, for the winter; certainly
till after Christmas, and then it depends on how my bills
&ldquo;turn out&rdquo; whether it shall not be till spring. So, meantime,
I must whistle in my cage. My cage is better by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>193</span>
one thing; I am an Advocate now. If you ask me why
that makes it better, I would remind you that in the most
distressing circumstances a little consequence goes a long
way, and even bereaved relatives stand on precedence
round the coffin. I idle finely. I read Boswell&rsquo;s <i>Life of
Johnson</i>, Martin&rsquo;s <i>History of France</i>, <i>Allan Ramsay</i>,
<i>Olivier Basselin</i>, all sorts of rubbish <i>àpropos</i> of <i>Burns</i>,
<i>Commines</i>, <i>Juvénal des Ursins</i>, etc. I walk about the
Parliament House five forenoons a week, in wig and
gown; I have either a five or six mile walk, or an hour
or two hard skating on the rink, every afternoon, without
fail.</p>

<p>I have not written much; but, like the seaman&rsquo;s
parrot in the tale, I have thought a deal. You have never,
by the way, returned me either <i>Spring</i> or <i>Béranger</i>, which
is certainly a d&mdash;&mdash;d shame. I always comforted myself
with that when my conscience pricked me about a letter
to you. &ldquo;Thus conscience&ldquo;&mdash;O no, that&rsquo;s not appropriate
in this connection.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p>The two following letters refer to the essay on the Spirit of
Spring which I was careless enough to lose in the process of a change
of rooms at Cambridge. <i>The Petits Poèmes en Prose</i> were attempts,
not altogether successful, in the form though not in the spirit of
Baudelaire.</p>

me if I can get my <i>Spring</i> printed? I want to print it;
because it&rsquo;s nice, and genuine to boot, and has got less
side on than my other game. Besides I want coin badly.</p>

<p>I am writing <i>Petits Poèmes en Prose</i>. Their principal
resemblance to Baudelaire&rsquo;s is that they are rather longer
and not quite so good. They are ve-ry cle-ver (words of
two syllables), O so aw-ful-ly cle-ver (words of three), O
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>196</span>
so dam-na-bly cle-ver (words of a devil of a number of
syllables). I have written fifteen in a fortnight. I have
also written some beautiful poetry. I would like a cake
and a cricket-bat; and a pass-key to Heaven if you please,
and as much money as my friend the Baron Rothschild
can spare. I used to look across to Rothschild of a morning
when we were brushing our hair, and say&mdash;(this is
quite true, only we were on the opposite side of the street,
and though I used to look over I cannot say I ever detected
the beggar, he feared to meet my eagle eye)&mdash;well, I used
to say to him, &ldquo;Rothschild, old man, lend us five hundred
francs,&rdquo; and it is characteristic of Rothy&rsquo;s dry humour
that he used never to reply when it was a question of
money. He was a very humorous dog indeed, was Rothy.
Heigh-ho! those happy old days. Funny, funny fellow,
the dear old Baron.</p>

<p>How&rsquo;s that for genuine American wit and humour?
Take notice of this in your answer; say, for instance,
&ldquo;Even although the letter had been unsigned, I could
have had no difficulty in guessing who was my dear,
<i>lively</i>, <i>witty</i> correspondent. Yours, Letitia Languish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>O!&mdash;my mind has given way. I have gone into a
mild, babbling, sunny idiocy. I shall buy a Jew&rsquo;s harp
and sit by the roadside with a woman&rsquo;s bonnet on my
manly head begging my honest livelihood. Meantime,

one was not unhappy anyway. I have got back a good

do not care whether I read, write, speak, or walk, so long
as I do something. I have a great delight in this wheel-skating;
I have made great advance in it of late, can do
a good many amusing things (I mean amusing in <i>my</i>

great pleasure to sit and hear cases argued or advised.
This is quite autobiographical, but I feel as if it was some

you again. In every way, you see, but that of work the
world goes well with me. My health is better than ever it
was before; I get on without any jar, nay, as if there
never had been a jar, with my parents. If it weren&rsquo;t
about that work, I&rsquo;d be happy. But the fact is, I don&rsquo;t
think&mdash;the fact is, I&rsquo;m going to trust in Providence about
work. If I could get one or two pieces I hate out of my
way all would be well, I think; but these obstacles disgust
me, and as I know I ought to do them first, I don&rsquo;t do
anything. I must finish this off, or I&rsquo;ll just lose another
day. I&rsquo;ll try to write again soon.&mdash;Ever your faithful

it will be a success. However, it&rsquo;s an amusement for the

the &ldquo;bearded people&rdquo; that squat upon their hams in the
dark places of life and embrace people horribly as

<p>I meant to write some more last night, but my father
was ill and it put it out of my way. He is better this
morning.</p>

<p>If I had written last night, I should have written a
lot. But this morning I am so dreadfully tired and
stupid that I can say nothing. I was down at Leith in
the afternoon. God bless me, what horrid women I saw;
I never knew what a plain-looking race it was before. I
was sick at heart with the looks of them. And the
children, filthy and ragged! And the smells! And the
fat black mud!</p>

<p>My soul was full of disgust ere I got back. And yet
the ships were beautiful to see, as they are always; and
on the pier there was a clean cold wind that smelt a little
of the sea, though it came down the Firth, and the sunset
had a certain <i>éclat</i> and warmth. Perhaps if I could get
more work done, I should be in a better trim to enjoy
filthy streets and people and cold grim weather; but I
don&rsquo;t much feel as if it was what I would have chosen.
I am tempted every day of my life to go off on another
walking tour. I like that better than anything else that

hard, with a grey sky with the leaves flying; and I have
nothing to say. I ought to have no doubt; since it&rsquo;s

is mighty like the last; you see I compare myself to a
lighthearted animal; and indeed I have been in a very

have taken a deal of exercise, and done some work. But
I have the strangest repugnance for writing; indeed, I
have nearly got myself persuaded into the notion that
letters don&rsquo;t arrive, in order to salve my conscience for
never sending them off. I&rsquo;m reading a great deal of

again laid aside, but in a good state of furtherance this

to Penzance, where at the post-office a letter will find me
glad and grateful. I am well, but somewhat tired out
with overwork. I have only been home a fortnight this
morning, and I have already written to the tune of forty-five
Cornhill pages and upwards. The most of it was
only very laborious re-casting and re-modelling, it is true;
but it took it out of me famously, all the same.</p>

<p>Temple Bar appears to like my <i>Villon</i>, so I may count
on another market there in the future, I hope. At least,
I am going to put it to the proof at once, and send another
story, <i>The Sire de Malétroit&rsquo;s Mousetrap</i>: a true novel,
in the old sense; all unities preserved moreover, if that&rsquo;s
anything, and I believe with some little merits; not so
<i>clever</i> perhaps as the last, but sounder and more natural.</p>

<p>My <i>Villon</i> is out this month; I should so much like
to know what you think of it. Stephen has written to
me à propos of <i>Idlers</i>, that something more in that vein
would be agreeable to his views. From Stephen I count
that a devil of a lot.</p>

I wish I could live like that, but, alas! it is just as well
I got my &ldquo;Idlers&rdquo; written and done with, for I have
quite lost all power of resting. I have a goad in my
flesh continually, pushing me to work, work, work. I have
an essay pretty well through for Stephen; a story, <i>The
Sire de Malétroit&rsquo;s Mousetrap</i>, with which I shall try Temple
Bar; another story, in the clouds, <i>The Stepfather&rsquo;s Story</i>,
most pathetic work of a high morality or immorality,
according to point of view; and lastly, also in the clouds,
or perhaps a little farther away, an essay on <i>The Two
St. Michael&rsquo;s Mounts</i>, historical and picturesque; perhaps
if it didn&rsquo;t come too long, I might throw in the <i>Bass
Rock</i>, and call it <i>Three Sea Fortalices</i>, or something of
that kind. You see how work keeps bubbling in my mind.
Then I shall do another fifteenth century paper this
autumn&mdash;La Sale and <i>Petit Jehan de Saintré</i>, which is a
kind of fifteenth century <i>Sandford and Merton</i>, ending in
horrid immoral cynicism, as if the author had got tired
of being didactic, and just had a good wallow in the mire
to wind up with and indemnify himself for so much
restraint.</p>

<p>Cornwall is not much to my taste, being as bleak as
the bleakest parts of Scotland, and nothing like so pointed
and characteristic. It has a flavour of its own, though,
which I may try and catch, if I find the space, in the
proposed article. <i>Will o&rsquo; the Mill</i> I sent, red hot, to
Stephen in a fit of haste, and have not yet had an answer.
I am quite prepared for a refusal. But I begin to have
more hope in the story line, and that should improve my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>208</span>
income anyway. I am glad you liked <i>Villon</i>; some of it
was not as good as it ought to be, but on the whole it seems
pretty vivid, and the features strongly marked. Vividness
and not style is now my line; style is all very well,
but vividness is the real line of country; if a thing is
meant to be read, it seems just as well to try and make it
readable. I am such a dull person now, I cannot keep
off my own immortal works. Indeed, they are scarcely
ever out of my head. And yet I value them less and less
every day. But occupation is the great thing; so that
a man should have his life in his own pocket, and never
be thrown out of work by anything. I am glad to hear
you are better. I must stop&mdash;going to Land&rsquo;s End.&mdash;Always

<p>This correspondent, living at the time in Australia, was, I believe,
the first to write and seek Stevenson&rsquo;s acquaintance from admiration
of his work, meaning especially the Cornhill essays of the
<i>Virginibus Puerisque</i> series so far as they had yet appeared. The
&ldquo;present&rdquo; herein referred to is Mr. Martin&rsquo;s volume called <i>A
Sweet Girl Graduate and other Poems</i> (Melbourne, 1876).</p>

<p class="rt">[1877]</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;It would not be very easy for me to give
you any idea of the pleasure I found in your present.
People who write for the magazines (probably from a
guilty conscience) are apt to suppose their works practically
unpublished. It seems unlikely that any one would
take the trouble to read a little paper buried among so
many others; and reading it, read it with any attention
or pleasure. And so, I can assure you, your little book,
coming from so far, gave me all the pleasure and encouragement
in the world.</p>

<p>I suppose you know and remember Charles Lamb&rsquo;s
essay on distant correspondents? Well, I was somewhat
of his way of thinking about my mild productions. I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>209</span>
not indeed imagine they were read, and (I suppose I may
say) enjoyed right round upon the other side of the big
Football we have the honour to inhabit. And as your
present was the first sign to the contrary, I feel I have
been very ungrateful in not writing earlier to acknowledge
the receipt. I dare say, however, you hate writing
letters as much as I can do myself (for if you like my
article, I may presume other points of sympathy between
us); and on this hypothesis you will be ready to forgive
me the delay.</p>

<p>I may mention with regard to the piece of verses called
<i>Such is Life</i> that I am not the only one on this side of the
Football aforesaid to think it a good and bright piece of
work, and recognised a link of sympathy with the poets
who &ldquo;play in hostelries at euchre.&rdquo;&mdash;Believe me, dear
sir, yours truly,</p>

<p class="rt"><i>17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh</i> [<i>December 1877</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;I am afraid you must already have
condemned me for a very idle fellow truly. Here it is
more than two months since I received your letter; I
had no fewer than three journals to acknowledge; and
never a sign upon my part. If you have seen a Cornhill
paper of mine upon idling, you will be inclined to set it
all down to that. But you will not be doing me justice.
Indeed, I have had a summer so troubled that I have
had little leisure and still less inclination to write letters.
I was keeping the devil at bay with all my disposable
activities; and more than once I thought he had me by
the throat. The odd conditions of our acquaintance
enable me to say more to you than I would to a person
who lived at my elbow. And besides, I am too much
pleased and flattered at our correspondence not to go as
far as I can to set myself right in your eyes.</p>

<p>In this damnable confusion (I beg pardon) I have lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>210</span>
all my possessions, or near about, and quite lost all my
wits. I wish I could lay my hands on the numbers of the
Review, for I know I wished to say something on that
head more particularly than I can from memory; but
where they have escaped to, only time or chance can
show. However, I can tell you so far, that I was very
much pleased with the article on Bret Harte; it seemed
to me just, clear, and to the point. I agreed pretty well
with all you said about George Eliot: a high, but, may
we not add?&mdash;a rather dry lady. Did you&mdash;I forget&mdash;did
you have a kick at the stern works of that melancholy
puppy and humbug Daniel Deronda himself?&mdash;the Prince
of Prigs; the literary abomination of desolation in the
way of manhood; a type which is enough to make a
man forswear the love of women, if that is how it must
be gained.... Hats off all the same, you understand:
a woman of genius.</p>

<p>Of your poems I have myself a kindness for <i>Noll and
Nell</i>, although I don&rsquo;t think you have made it as good
as you ought: verse five is surely not <i>quite melodious</i>.
I confess I like the Sonnet in the last number of the Review&mdash;the
<i>Sonnet to England</i>.</p>

<p>Please, if you have not, and I don&rsquo;t suppose you have,
already read it, institute a search in all Melbourne for
one of the rarest and certainly one of the best of books&mdash;<i>Clarissa
Harlowe</i>. For any man who takes an interest
in the problems of the two sexes, that book is a perfect
mine of documents. And it is written, sir, with the pen
of an angel. Miss Howe and Lovelace, words cannot
tell how good they are! And the scene where Clarissa
beards her family, with her fan going all the while; and
some of the quarrel scenes between her and Lovelace;
and the scene where Colonel Marden goes to Mr. Hall, with
Lord M. trying to compose matters, and the Colonel with
his eternal &ldquo;finest woman in the world,&rdquo; and the inimitable
affirmation of Mobray&mdash;nothing, nothing could be better!
You will bless me when you read it for this recommendation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>211</span>
but, indeed, I can do nothing but recommend Clarissa. I
am like that Frenchman of the eighteenth century who
discovered Habakkuk, and would give no one peace about
that respectable Hebrew. For my part, I never was able
to get over his eminently respectable name; Isaiah is
the boy, if you must have a prophet, no less. About
Clarissa, I meditate a choice work: <i>A Dialogue on Man,
Woman, and &ldquo;Clarissa Harlowe.&rdquo;</i> It is to be so clever
that no array of terms can give you any idea; and very
likely that particular array in which I shall finally embody
it, less than any other.</p>

<p>Do you know, my dear sir, what I like best in your letter?
The egotism for which you thought necessary to apologise.
I am a rogue at egotism myself; and to be plain, I have
rarely or never liked any man who was not. The first
step to discovering the beauties of God&rsquo;s universe is usually
a (perhaps partial) apprehension of such of them as adorn
our own characters. When I see a man who does not
think pretty well of himself, I always suspect him of being
in the right. And besides, if he does not like himself,
whom he has seen, how is he ever to like one whom he
never can see but in dim and artificial presentments?</p>

<p>I cordially reciprocate your offer of a welcome; it shall
be at least a warm one. Are you not my first, my only,
admirer&mdash;a dear tie? Besides, you are a man of sense,
and you treat me as one by writing to me as you do, and
that gives me pleasure also. Please continue to let me
see your work. I have one or two things coming out in
the Cornhill: a story called <i>The Sire de Malétroit&rsquo;s Door</i>
in Temple Bar; and a series of articles on Edinburgh in
the Portfolio; but I don&rsquo;t know if these last fly all the
way to Melbourne.&mdash;Yours very truly,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for your letter. I
was much interested by all the Edinburgh gossip. Most
likely I shall arrive in London next week. I think you
know all about the Crane sketch; but it should be a
river, not a canal, you know, and the look should be &ldquo;cruel,
lewd, and kindly,&rdquo; all at once. There is more sense in
that Greek myth of Pan than in any other that I recollect
except the luminous Hebrew one of the Fall: one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>213</span>
biggest things done. If people would remember that all
religions are no more than representations of life, they
would find them, as they are, the best representations,
licking Shakespeare.</p>

<p>What an inconceivable cheese is Alfred de Musset!
His comedies are, to my view, the best work of France
this century: a large order. Did you ever read them?
They are real, clear, living work.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FATHER</span>,&mdash;A thought has come into my head
which I think would interest you. Christianity is among
other things, a very wise, noble, and strange doctrine of
life. Nothing is so difficult to specify as the position it
occupies with regard to asceticism. It is not ascetic.
Christ was of all doctors (if you will let me use the word)
one of the least ascetic. And yet there is a theory of
living in the Gospels which is curiously indefinable, and
leans towards asceticism on one side, although it leans
away from it on the other. In fact, asceticism is used
therein as a means, not as an end. The wisdom of this
world consists in making oneself very little in order to
avoid many knocks; in preferring others, in order that,
even when we lose, we shall find some pleasure in the
event; in putting our desires outside of ourselves, in
another ship, so to speak, so that, when the worst happens,
there will be something left. You see, I speak of it as a
doctrine of life, and as a wisdom for this world. People
must be themselves, I suppose. I feel every day as if
religion had a greater interest for me; but that interest
is still centred on the little rough-and-tumble world in
which our fortunes are cast for the moment. I cannot
transfer my interests, not even my religious interest, to
any different sphere.... I have had some sharp lessons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>214</span>
and some very acute sufferings in these last seven-and-twenty
years&mdash;more even than you would guess. I begin
to grow an old man; a little sharp, I fear, and a little
close and unfriendly; but still I have a good heart, and
believe in myself and my fellow-men and the God who
made us all.... There are not many sadder people in
this world, perhaps, than I. I have my eye on a sickbed;<a name="FnAnchor_22" href="#Footnote_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
I have written letters to-day that it hurt me to
write, and I fear it will hurt others to receive; I am
lonely and sick and out of heart. Well, I still hope; I
still believe; I still see the good in the inch, and cling
to it. It is not much, perhaps, but it is always something.</p>

<p>I find I have wandered a thousand miles from what
I meant. It was this: of all passages bearing on Christianity
in that form of a worldly wisdom, the most Christian,
and so to speak, the key of the whole position, is
the Christian doctrine of revenge. And it appears that
this came into the world through Paul! There is a fact
for you. It was to speak of this that I began this letter;
but I have got into deep seas and must go on.</p>

<p>There is a fine text in the Bible, I don&rsquo;t know where,
to the effect that all things work together for good to
those who love the Lord. Strange as it may seem to you,
everything has been, in one way or the other, bringing
me a little nearer to what I think you would like me to
be. &rsquo;Tis a strange world, indeed, but there is a manifest
God for those who care to look for him.</p>

<p>This is a very solemn letter for my surroundings in
this busy café; but I had it on my heart to write it; and,
indeed, I was out of the humour for anything lighter.&mdash;Ever
your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;While I am writing gravely, let me say one
word more. I have taken a step towards more intimate
relations with you. But don&rsquo;t expect too much of me.
Try to take me as I am. This is a rare moment, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>215</span>
have profited by it; but take it as a rare moment. Usually
I hate to speak of what I really feel, to that extent that
when I find myself <i>cornered</i>, I have a tendency to say
the reverse.</p>

you, and yet he never does; or rather, he never does,
until he gets near the end, when he begins to wean you
from him, so that you&rsquo;re as pleased to be done with him
as you thought you would be sorry. I wonder if it&rsquo;s old
age? It is a little, I am sure. A young person would
get sickened by the dead level of meanness and cowardliness;
you require to be a little spoiled and cynical before
you can enjoy it. I have just finished the <i>Way of the
World</i>; there is only one person in it&mdash;no, there are three&mdash;who
are nice: the wild American woman, and two of
the dissipated young men, Dolly and Lord Nidderdale.
All the heroes and heroines are just ghastly. But what
a triumph is Lady Carbury! That is real, sound, strong,
genuine work: the man who could do that, if he had
had courage, might have written a fine book; he has
preferred to write many readable ones. I meant to write
such a long, nice letter, but I cannot hold the pen.</p>

it cost three francs a head. So that it was inexpensive

fiver. How, and why, do you continue to exist? I do
so ill, but for a variety of reasons. First, I wait an angel
to come down and trouble the waters; second, more
angels; third&mdash;well, more angels. The waters are sluggish;
the angels&mdash;well, the angels won&rsquo;t come, that&rsquo;s
about all. But I sit waiting and waiting, and people
bring me meals, which help to pass time (I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s
very kind of them), and sometimes I whistle to myself;
and as there&rsquo;s a very pretty echo at my pool of Siloam,
the thing&rsquo;s agreeable to hear. The sun continues to rise
every day, to my growing wonder. &ldquo;The moon by night
thee shall not smite.&rdquo; And the stars are all doing as well
as can be expected. The air of Arcady is very brisk and
pure, and we command many enchanting prospects in
space and time. I do not yet know much about my situation;
for, to tell the truth, I only came here by the run
since I began to write this letter; I had to go back to
date it; and I am grateful to you for having been the
occasion of this little outing. What good travellers we
are, if we had only faith; no man need stay in Edinburgh
but by unbelief; my religious organ has been ailing for a
while past, and I have lain a great deal in Edinburgh, a
sheer hulk in consequence. But I got out my wings, and
have taken a change of air.</p>

<p>I read your book with great interest, and ought long
ago to have told you so. An ordinary man would say
that he had been waiting till he could pay his debts....
The book is good reading. Your personal notes of
those you saw struck me as perhaps most sharp and
&ldquo;best held.&rdquo; See as many people as you can, and make
a book of them before you die. That will be a living
book, upon my word. You have the touch required. I
ask you to put hands to it in private already. Think of
what Carlyle&rsquo;s caricature of old Coleridge is to us who
never saw S. T. C. With that and <i>Kubla Khan</i>, we have
the man in the fact. Carlyle&rsquo;s picture, of course, is not of
the author of <i>Kubla</i>, but of the author of that surprising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>221</span>
<i>Friend</i> which has knocked the breath out of two generations
of hopeful youth. Your portraits would be milder,
sweeter, more true perhaps, and perhaps not so truth-<i>telling</i>&mdash;if
you will take my meaning.</p>

<p>I have to thank you for an introduction to that
beautiful&mdash;no, that&rsquo;s not the word&mdash;that jolly, with an
Arcadian jollity&mdash;thing of Vogelweide&rsquo;s. Also for your
preface. Some day I want to read a whole book in the
same picked dialect as that preface. I think it must be
one E. W. Gosse who must write it. He has got himself
into a fix with me by writing the preface; I look for a
great deal, and will not be easily pleased.</p>

<p>I never thought of it, but my new book, which should
soon be out, contains a visit to a murder scene, but not
done as we should like to see them, for, of course, I was
running another hare.</p>

<p>If you do not answer this in four pages, I shall stop
the enclosed fiver at the bank, a step which will lead to
your incarceration for life. As my visits to Arcady are
somewhat uncertain, you had better address 17 Heriot

note if I am not yet home.&mdash;Believe me, very really

<p>Impromptu poem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to Shandon Hydropathic <i>cum parentibus</i>.
Write here. I heard from Lang. Ferrier prayeth to be remembered;
he means to write, likes his Tourgenieff greatly.
Also likes my <i>What was on the Slate</i>, which, under a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>223</span>
title, yet unfound, and with a new and, on the whole, kindly
<i>dénouement</i>, is going to shoot up and become a star....</p>

<p>I see I must write some more to you about my Monastery.
I am a weak brother in verse. You ask me to
re-write things that I have already managed just to write
with the skin of my teeth. If I don&rsquo;t re-write them, it&rsquo;s
because I don&rsquo;t see how to write them better, not because
I don&rsquo;t think they should be. But, curiously enough,
you condemn two of my favourite passages, one of which
is J. W. Ferrier&rsquo;s favourite of the whole. Here I shall
think it&rsquo;s you who are wrong. You see, I did not try to
make good verse, but to say what I wanted as well as
verse would let me. I don&rsquo;t like the rhyme &ldquo;ear&rdquo; and
&ldquo;hear.&rdquo; But the couplet, &ldquo;My undissuaded heart I hear
Whisper courage in my ear,&rdquo; is exactly what I want for
the thought, and to me seems very energetic as speech,
if not as verse. Would &ldquo;daring&rdquo; be better than
&ldquo;courage&ldquo;? <i>Je me le demande.</i> No, it would be
ambiguous, as though I had used it licentiously for
&ldquo;daringly,&rdquo; and that would cloak the sense.</p>

<p>In short, your suggestions have broken the heart of
the scald. He doesn&rsquo;t agree with them all; and those
he does agree with, the spirit indeed is willing, but the
d&mdash;&mdash;d flesh cannot, cannot, cannot, see its way to profit
by. I think I&rsquo;ll lay it by for nine years, like Horace. I
think the well of Castaly&rsquo;s run out. No more the Muses
round my pillow haunt. I am fallen once more to the
mere proser. God bless you.</p>

<p>Chapters <span class="sc">VIII</span>. and <span class="sc">IX</span>. of Meredith&rsquo;s story are very
good, I think. But who wrote the review of my book?
Whoever he was, he cannot write; he is humane, but a
duffer; I could weep when I think of him; for surely to
be virtuous and incompetent is a hard lot. I should
prefer to be a bold pirate, the gay sailor-boy of immorality,
and a publisher at once. My mind is extinct;
my appetite is expiring; I have fallen altogether into a
hollow-eyed, yawning way of life, like the parties in Burne
Jones&rsquo;s pictures.... Talking of Burns. (Is this not
sad, Weg? I use the term of reproach not because I am
angry with you this time, but because I am angry with
myself and desire to give pain.) Talking, I say, of Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>225</span>
Burns, the inspired poet is a very gay subject for study.
I made a kind of chronological table of his various loves
and lusts, and have been comparatively speechless ever
since. I am sorry to say it, but there was something in
him of the vulgar, bagmanlike, professional seducer.&mdash;Oblige
me by taking down and reading, for the hundredth
time, I hope, his <i>Twa Dogs</i> and his <i>Address to the Unco
Guid</i>. I am only a Scotchman, after all, you see; and
when I have beaten Burns, I am driven at once, by my
parental feelings, to console him with a sugar-plum. But
hang me if I know anything I like so well as the <i>Twa
Dogs</i>. Even a common Englishman may have a glimpse,
as it were from Pisgah, of its extraordinary merits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>English, The</i>:&mdash;a dull people, incapable of comprehending
the Scottish tongue. Their history is so intimately
connected with that of Scotland, that we must
refer our readers to that heading. Their literature is
principally the work of venal Scots.&rdquo;&mdash;Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>Handy
Cyclopædia</i>. Glescow: Blaikie &amp; Bannock.</p>

<p>Remember me in suitable fashion to Mrs. Gosse, the
offspring, and the cat.&mdash;And believe me ever yours,</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><i>Rembrandt</i> refers to an article in the Edinburgh Review.
&ldquo;Bummkopf&rdquo; was Stevenson&rsquo;s name for the typical pedant,
German or other, who cannot clear his edifice of its scaffolding,
nor set forth the results of research without intruding on the reader
all its processes, evidences, and supports. <i>Burns</i> is the aforesaid
Cornhill essay: not the rejected Encyclopædia article.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh</i> [<i>July 28, 1879</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I am just in the middle of your
<i>Rembrandt</i>. The taste for Bummkopf and his works is
agreeably dissembled so far as I have gone; and the
reins have never for an instant been thrown upon the
neck of that wooden Pegasus; he only perks up a learned
snout from a footnote in the cellarage of a paragraph;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>226</span>
just, in short, where he ought to be, to inspire confidence
in a wicked and adulterous generation. But, mind you,
Bummkopf is not human; he is Dagon the fish god, and
down he will come, sprawling on his belly or his behind,
with his hands broken from his helpless carcase, and his
head rolling oft into a corner. Up will rise on the other
side, sane, pleasurable, human knowledge: a thing of
beauty and a joy, etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m three parts through <i>Burns</i>; long, dry, unsympathetic,
but sound and, I think, in its dry way, interesting.
Next I shall finish the story, and then perhaps
Thoreau. Meredith has been staying with Morley, has
been cracking me up, he writes, to that literary Robespierre;
and he (the L. R.) is about, it is believed, to
write to me on a literary scheme. Is it Keats, hope you?
My heart leaps at the thought.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="to">To Edmund Gosse</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>With reference to the &ldquo;term of reproach,&rdquo; it must be explained
that Mr. Gosse, who now signs with only one initial, used in these
days to sign with two, E. W. G. The nickname Weg was fastened
on him by Stevenson, partly under a false impression as to the order
of these initials, partly in friendly derision of a passing fit of lameness,
which called up the memory of Silas Wegg, the immortal
literary gentleman &ldquo;<i>with</i> a wooden leg&rdquo; of <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh</i> [<i>July 29, 1879</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;Yours was delicious; you are a
young person of wit; one of the last of them; wit being
quite out of date, and humour confined to the Scotch
Church and the <i>Spectator</i> in unconscious survival. You
will probably be glad to hear that I am up again in
the world; I have breathed again, and had a frolic
on the strength of it. The frolic was yesterday, Sawbath;
the scene, the Royal Hotel, Bathgate; I went there with a
humorous friend to lunch. The maid soon showed herself
a lass of character. She was looking out of window.
On being asked what she was after, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; for my
lad,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Is that him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Weel, I&rsquo;ve been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>227</span>
lookin&rsquo; for him a&rsquo; my life, and I&rsquo;ve never seen him yet,&rdquo;
was the response. I wrote her some verses in the vernacular;
she read them. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re no bad for a beginner,&rdquo;
said she. The landlord&rsquo;s daughter, Miss Stewart,
was present in oil colour; so I wrote her a declaration in
verse, and sent it by the handmaid. She (Miss S.) was
present on the stair to witness our departure, in a warm,
suffused condition. Damn it, Gosse, you needn&rsquo;t suppose
that you&rsquo;re the only poet in the world.</p>

<p>Your statement about your initials, it will be seen, I
pass over in contempt and silence. When once I have made
up my mind, let me tell you, sir, there lives no pock-pudding
who can change it. Your anger I defy. Your unmanly
reference to a well-known statesman I puff from me, sir,
like so much vapour. Weg is your name; Weg. W E G.</p>

<p>My enthusiasm has kind of dropped from me. I envy
you your wife, your home, your child&mdash;I was going to
say your cat. There would be cats in my home too if I
could but get it. I may seem to you &ldquo;the impersonation
of life,&rdquo; but my life is the impersonation of waiting,
and that&rsquo;s a poor creature. God help us all, and the deil
be kind to the hindmost! Upon my word, we are a
brave, cheery crew, we human beings, and my admiration
increases daily&mdash;primarily for myself, but by a roundabout
process for the whole crowd; for I dare say they
have all their poor little secrets and anxieties. And
here am I, for instance, writing to you as if you were
in the seventh heaven, and yet I know you are in a sad
anxiety yourself. I hope earnestly it will soon be over,
and a fine pink Gosse sprawling in a tub, and a mother
in the best of health and spirits, glad and tired, and with
another interest in life. Man, you are out of the trouble
when this is through. A first child is a rival, but a second
is only a rival to the first; and the husband stands his
ground and may keep married all his life&mdash;a consummation
heartily to be desired. Good-bye, Gosse. Write me
a witty letter with good news of the mistress.</p>

<h3>THE AMATEUR EMIGRANT</h3>

<h5>S.S. DEVONIA&mdash;MONTEREY AND SAN
FRANCISCO&mdash;MARRIAGE</h5>

<h6>July 1879-July 1880</h6>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> France, as has been already indicated, Stevenson had
met the American lady, Mrs. Osbourne, who was afterwards
to become his wife. Her domestic relations had not
been fortunate; to his chivalrous nature her circumstances
appealed no less than her person; and almost
from their first meeting, which befell at Grez, immediately
after the canoe voyage of 1876, he conceived for her an
attachment which was to transform and determine his
life. On her return to America with her children in the
autumn of 1878, she determined to seek a divorce from her
husband. Hearing of her intention, together with very
disquieting news of her health, and hoping that after she
had obtained the divorce he might make her his wife,
Stevenson suddenly started for California at the beginning
of August 1879.</p>

<p>For what he knew must seem to his friends, and
especially to his father, so wild an errand, he would ask
for no supplies from home; but resolved, risking his
whole future on the issue, to test during this adventure
his power of supporting himself, and eventually others,
by his own labours in literature. In order from the outset
to save as much as possible, he made the journey in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>229</span>
the steerage and the emigrant train. With this prime
motive of economy was combined a second&mdash;that of learning
for himself the pinch of life as it is felt by the unprivileged
and the poor (he had long ago disclaimed for
himself the character of a &ldquo;consistent first-class passenger
in life&ldquo;)&mdash;and also, it should be added, a third,
that of turning his experiences to literary account. On
board ship he took daily notes with this intent, and wrote
moreover <i>The Story of a Lie</i> for an English magazine.
Arrived at his destination, he found his health, as was
natural, badly shaken by the hardships of the journey;
tried his favourite open-air cure for three weeks at an
Angora goat-ranche some twenty miles from Monterey;
and then lived from September to December in that old
Californian coast-town itself, under the conditions set
forth in the earlier of the following letters, and under a
heavy combined strain of personal anxiety and literary
effort. From the notes taken on board ship and in the
emigrant train he drafted an account of his journey, intending
to make a volume matching in form, though in
contents much unlike, the earlier <i>Inland Voyage</i> and
<i>Travels with a Donkey</i>. He wrote also the essays on
Thoreau and the Japanese reformer, Yoshida Torajiro,
afterwards published in <i>Familiar Studies of Men and
Books</i>; one of the most vivid of his shorter tales, <i>The
Pavilion on the Links</i>, hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;blood
and thunder,&rdquo; as well as a great part of another and
longer story drawn from his new experiences and called
<i>A Vendetta in the West</i>; but this did not satisfy him,
and was never finished. He planned at the same time, in
the spirit of romantic comedy, that tale which took final
shape four years later as <i>Prince Otto</i>. Towards the end of
December 1879 Stevenson moved to San Francisco, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>230</span>
he lived for three months in a workman&rsquo;s lodging, leading
a life of frugality amounting, it will be seen, to self-imposed
penury, and working always with the same intensity
of application, until his health utterly broke down.
One of the causes which contributed to his illness was
the fatigue he underwent in helping to watch beside the
sickbed of a child, the son of his landlady. During a
part of March and April he lay at death&rsquo;s door&mdash;his first
really dangerous sickness since childhood&mdash;and was slowly
tended back to life by the joint ministrations of his future
wife and the physician to whom his letter of thanks will
be found below. His marriage ensued in May 1880;
immediately afterwards, to try and consolidate his recovery,
he moved to a deserted mining-camp in the
Californian coast range; and has recorded the aspects
and humours of his life there with a master&rsquo;s touch in
the <i>Silverado Squatters</i>.</p>

<p>The news of his dangerous illness and approaching
marriage had in the meantime unlocked the parental
heart and purse; supplies were sent ensuring his present
comfort, with the promise of their continuance for the
future, and of a cordial welcome for the new daughter-in-law
in his father&rsquo;s house. The following letters, chosen
from among those written during the period in question,
depict his way of life, and reflect at once the anxiety of
his friends and the strain of the time upon himself.</p>

<p>I shall write a general procuration about this story on
another bit of paper. I am not very well; bad food, bad
air, and hard work have brought me down. But the
spirits keep good. The voyage has been most interesting,
and will make, if not a series of <i>Pall Mall</i> articles, at
least the first part of a new book. The last weight on
me has been trying to keep notes for this purpose.
Indeed, I have worked like a horse, and am now
as tired as a donkey. If I should have to push on
far by rail, I shall bring nothing but my fine bones
to port.</p>

<p>Good-bye to you all. I suppose it is now late afternoon

<p><i>P.S</i>.&mdash;I go on my way to-night, if I can; if not, to-morrow;
emigrant train ten to fourteen days&rsquo; journey;
warranted extreme discomfort. The only American institution
which has yet won my respect is the rain. One
sees it is a new country, they are so free with their water.
I have been steadily drenched for twenty-four hours;
water-proof wet through; immortal spirit fitfully blinking
up in spite. Bought a copy of my own work, and the man
said &ldquo;by Stevenson.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; says I.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo;
says he.&mdash;Scene closes.</p>

<p>I am not beaten yet, though disappointed. If I am,
it&rsquo;s for good this time; you know what &ldquo;for good&rdquo;
means in my vocabulary&mdash;something inside of 12 months
perhaps; but who knows? At least, if I fail in my great
purpose, I shall see some wild life in the West and visit
both Florida and Labrador ere I return. But I don&rsquo;t yet
know if I have the courage to stick to life without it.
Man, I was sick, sick, sick of this last year.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Crossing Nebraska</i> [<i>Saturday, August 23, 1879</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;I am sitting on the top of the
cars with a mill party from Missouri going west for his
health. Desolate flat prairie upon all hands. Here and
there a herd of cattle, a yellow butterfly or two; a patch
of wild sunflowers; a wooden house or two; then a
wooden church alone in miles of waste; then a windmill
to pump water. When we stop, which we do often, for
emigrants and freight travel together, the kine first, the
men after, the whole plain is heard singing with cicadae.
This is a pause, as you may see from the writing. What
happened to the old pedestrian emigrants, what was the
tedium suffered by the Indians and trappers of our youth,
the imagination trembles to conceive. This is now
Saturday, 23rd, and I have been steadily travelling since
I parted from you at St. Pancras. It is a strange vicissitude
from the Savile Club to this; I sleep with a man
from Pennsylvania who has been in the States Navy, and
mess with him and the Missouri bird already alluded to.
We have a tin wash-bowl among four. I wear nothing
but a shirt and a pair of trousers, and never button my
shirt. When I land for a meal, I pass my coat and feel
dressed. This life is to last till Friday, Saturday, or
Sunday next. It is a strange affair to be an emigrant, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>234</span>
I hope you shall see in a future work. I wonder if this
will be legible; my present station on the waggon roof,
though airy compared to the cars, is both dirty and insecure.
I can see the track straight before and straight
behind me to either horizon. Peace of mind I enjoy with
extreme serenity; I am doing right; I know no one will
think so; and don&rsquo;t care. My body, however, is all to
whistles; I don&rsquo;t eat; but, man, I can sleep. The car
in front of mine is chock full of Chinese.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;What it is to be ill in an emigrant train let
those declare who know. I slept none till late in the
morning, overcome with laudanum, of which I had luckily
a little bottle. All to-day I have eaten nothing, and
only drunk two cups of tea, for each of which, on the
pretext that the one was breakfast, and the other dinner,
I was charged fifty cents. Our journey is through ghostly
deserts, sage brush and alkali, and rocks, without form or
colour, a sad corner of the world. I confess I am not
jolly, but mighty calm, in my distresses. My illness is a
subject of great mirth to some of my fellow-travellers,
and I smile rather sickly at their jests.</p>

<p>We are going along Bitter Creek just now, a place
infamous in the history of emigration, a place I shall
remember myself among the blackest. I hope I may get
this posted at Ogden, Utah.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Coast Line Mountains, California, September, 1879.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="sc">Here</span> is another curious start in my life. I am living
at an Angora goat-ranche, in the Coast Line Mountains,
eighteen miles from Monterey. I was camping out, but
got so sick that the two rancheros took me in and tended
me. One is an old bear-hunter, seventy-two years old,
and a captain from the Mexican war; the other a pilgrim,
and one who was out with the bear flag and under Fremont
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>235</span>

true frontiersmen, and most kind and pleasant. Captain
Smith, the bear-hunter, is my physician, and I obey him
like an oracle.</p>

<p>The business of my life stands pretty nigh still. I
work at my notes of the voyage. It will not be very like
a book of mine; but perhaps none the less successful for
that. I will not deny that I feel lonely to-day; but I do
not fear to go on, for I am doing right. I have not yet
had a word from England, partly, I suppose, because I
have not yet written for my letters to New York; do not
blame me for this neglect; if you knew all I have been
through, you would wonder I had done so much as I
have. I teach the ranche children reading in the

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I received your letter with delight;
it was the first word that reached me from the old country.
I am in good health now; I have been pretty seedy, for
I was exhausted by the journey and anxiety below even
my point of keeping up; I am still a little weak, but
that is all; I begin to ingrease,<a name="FnAnchor_23" href="#Footnote_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> it seems, already. My
book is about half drafted: the <i>Amateur Emigrant</i>, that
is. Can you find a better name? I believe it will be
more popular than any of my others; the canvas is so
much more popular and larger too. Fancy, it is my
fourth. That voluminous writer. I was vexed to hear
about the last chapter of <i>The Lie</i>, and pleased to hear
about the rest; it would have been odd if it had no
birthmark, born where and how it was. It should by
rights have been called the <i>Devonia</i>, for that is the habit
with all children born in a steerage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>236</span></p>

<p>I write to you, hoping for more. Give me news of all
who concern me, near or far, or big or little. Here, sir,
in California you have a willing hearer.</p>

<p>Monterey is a place where there is no summer or
winter, and pines and sand and distant hills and a bay
all filled with real water from the Pacific. You will perceive
that no expense has been spared. I now live with
a little French doctor; I take one of my meals in a little
French restaurant; for the other two, I sponge. The
population of Monterey is about that of a dissenting chapel
on a wet Sunday in a strong church neighbourhood. They
are mostly Mexican and Indian&mdash;mixed.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p class="to">To Edmund Gosse</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Monterey, 8th October 1879.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR WEG</span>,&mdash;I know I am a rogue and the son of
a dog. Yet let me tell you, when I came here I had a
week&rsquo;s misery and a fortnight&rsquo;s illness, and since then
I have been more or less busy in being content. This is
a kind of excuse for my laziness. I hope you will not
excuse yourself. My plans are still very uncertain, and
it is not likely that anything will happen before Christmas.
In the meanwhile, I believe I shall live on here
&ldquo;between the sandhills and the sea,&rdquo; as I think Mr.
Swinburne hath it. I was pretty nearly slain; my spirit
lay down and kicked for three days; I was up at an
Angora goat-ranche in the Santa Lucia Mountains, nursed
by an old frontiersman, a mighty hunter of bears, and I
scarcely slept, or ate, or thought for four days. Two
nights I lay out under a tree in a sort of stupor, doing
nothing but fetch water for myself and horse, light a fire
and make coffee, and all night awake hearing the goat-bells
ringing and the tree-frogs singing when each new
noise was enough to set me mad. Then the bear-hunter
came round, pronounced me &ldquo;real sick,&rdquo; and ordered me
up to the ranche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>237</span></p>

<p>It was an odd, miserable piece of my life; and according
to all rule, it should have been my death; but after
a while my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy, and has
since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great
emphasis and success.</p>

<p>My new book, <i>The Amateur Emigrant</i>, is about half
drafted. I don&rsquo;t know if it will be good, but I think it
ought to sell in spite of the deil and the publishers; for
it tells an odd enough experience, and one, I think, never
yet told before. Look for my <i>Burns</i> in the Cornhill, and
for my <i>Story of a Lie</i> in Paul&rsquo;s withered babe, the New
Quarterly. You may have seen the latter ere this reaches
you; tell me if it has any interest, like a good boy, and
remember that it was written at sea in great anxiety of
mind. What is your news? Send me your works, like
an angel, <i>au fur et à mesure</i> of their apparation, for
I am naturally short of literature, and I do not wish
to rust.</p>

<p>I fear this can hardly be called a letter. To say truth,
I feel already a difficulty of approach; I do not know if
I am the same man I was in Europe, perhaps I can hardly
claim acquaintance with you. My head went round and
looks another way now; for when I found myself over
here in a new land, and all the past uprooted in the one
tug, and I neither feeling glad nor sorry, I got my last
lesson about mankind; I mean my latest lesson, for of
course I do not know what surprises there are yet in store
for me. But that I could have so felt astonished me
beyond description. There is a wonderful callousness in
human nature which enables us to live. I had no feeling
one way or another from New York to California, until,
at Dutch Flat, a mining camp in the Sierra, I heard a
cock crowing with a home voice; and then I fell to hope
and regret both in the same moment.</p>

<p>Is there a boy or a girl? and how is your wife? I
thought of you more than once, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>I live here comfortably enough; but I shall soon be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>238</span>
left all alone, perhaps till Christmas. Then you may

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;Herewith the <i>Pavilion on the
Links</i>, grand carpentry story in nine chapters, and I
should hesitate to say how many tableaux. Where is it
to go? God knows. It is the dibbs that are wanted.
It is not bad, though I say it; carpentry, of course, but
not bad at that; and who else can carpenter in England,
now that Wilkie Collins is played out? It might be
broken for magazine purposes at the end of Chapter IV.
I send it to you, as I dare say Payn may help, if all else
fails. Dibbs and speed are my mottoes.</p>

<p>Do acknowledge the <i>Pavilion</i> by return. I shall be
so nervous till I hear, as of course I have no copy except
of one or two places where the vein would not run. God
prosper it, poor <i>Pavilion</i>! May it bring me money for
myself and my sick one, who may read it, I do not know
how soon.</p>

</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Monterey, October 1879.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for your good letter,
which is the best way to forgive you for your previous
silence. I hope Colvin or somebody has sent me the
Cornhill and the New Quarterly, though I am trying to
get them in San Francisco. I think you might have
sent me (1) some of your articles in the P. M. G.<a name="FnAnchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a>; (2) a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>239</span>
paper with the announcement of second edition; and
(3) the announcement of the essays in Athenæum. This
to prick you in the future. Again, choose, in your head,
the best volume of Labiche there is, and post it to Jules
Simoneau, Monterey, Monterey Co., California: do this
at once, as he is my restaurant man, a most pleasant old
boy with whom I discuss the universe and play chess
daily. He has been out of France for thirty-five years,
and never heard of Labiche. I have eighty-three pages
written of a story called <i>A Vendetta in the West</i>, and
about sixty pages of the first draft of the <i>Amateur
Emigrant</i>. They should each cover from 130 to 150
pages when done. That is all my literary news. Do
keep me posted, won&rsquo;t you? Your letter and Bob&rsquo;s
made the fifth and sixth I have had from Europe
in three months.</p>

<p>At times I get terribly frightened about my work,
which seems to advance too slowly. I hope soon to have
a greater burden to support, and must make money a
great deal quicker than I used. I may get nothing for
the <i>Vendetta</i>; I may only get some forty quid for the
<i>Emigrant</i>; I cannot hope to have them both done much
before the end of November.</p>

<p>O, and look here, why did you not send me the Spectator
which slanged me? Rogues and rascals, is that
all you are worth?</p>

<p>Yesterday I set fire to the forest, for which, had I
been caught, I should have been hung out of hand to the
nearest tree, Judge Lynch being an active person hereaway.
You should have seen my retreat (which was
entirely for strategical purposes). I ran like hell. It was
a fine sight. At night I went out again to see it; it was
a good fire, though I say it that should not. I had a
near escape for my life with a revolver: I fired six
charges, and the six bullets all remained in the barrel,
which was choked from end to end, from muzzle to
breach, with solid lead; it took a man three hours to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>240</span>
drill them out. Another shot, and I&rsquo;d have gone to
kingdom come.</p>

<p>This is a lovely place, which I am growing to love.
The Pacific licks all other oceans out of hand; there is
no place but the Pacific Coast to hear eternal roaring
surf. When I get to the top of the woods behind
Monterey, I can hear the seas breaking all round over
ten or twelve miles of coast from near Carmel on my left,
out to Point Pinas in front, and away to the right along
the sands of Monterey to Castroville and the mouth of
the Salinas. I was wishing yesterday that the world
could get&mdash;no, what I mean was that you should be kept
in suspense like Mahomet&rsquo;s coffin until the world had
made half a revolution, then dropped here at the station
as though you had stepped from the cars; you would then
comfortably enter Walter&rsquo;s waggon (the sun has just gone
down, the moon beginning to throw shadows, you hear
the surf rolling, and smell the sea and the pines). That
shall deposit you at Sanchez&rsquo;s saloon, where we take a
drink; you are introduced to Bronson, the local editor
(&ldquo;I have no brain music,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mechanic, you
see,&rdquo; but he&rsquo;s a nice fellow); to Adolpho Sanchez, who
is delightful. Meantime I go to the P. O. for my mail;
thence we walk up Alvarado Street together, you now
floundering in the sand, now merrily stumping on the
wooden side-walks; I call at Hadsell&rsquo;s for my paper; at
length behold us installed in Simoneau&rsquo;s little white-washed
back-room, round a dirty tablecloth, with François
the baker, perhaps an Italian fisherman, perhaps Augustin
Dutra, and Simoneau himself. Simoneau, François, and I
are the three sure cards; the others mere waifs. Then
home to my great airy rooms with five windows opening
on a balcony; I sleep on the floor in my camp blankets;
you instal yourself abed; in the morning coffee with the
little doctor and his little wife; we hire a waggon and
make a day of it; and by night, I should let you up
again into the air, to be returned to Mrs. Henley in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"></a>241</span>
forenoon following. By God, you would enjoy yourself.
So should I. I have tales enough to keep you going till
five in the morning, and then they would not be at an
end. I forget if you asked me any questions, and I sent
your letter up to the city to one who will like to read it.
I expect other letters now steadily. If I have to wait
another two months, I shall begin to be happy. Will you
remember me most affectionately to your wife? Shake
hands with Anthony from me; and God bless your
mother.</p>

<p>God bless Stephen! Does he not know that I am a
man, and cannot live by bread alone, but must have
guineas into the bargain. <i>Burns</i>, I believe, in my own
mind, is one of my high-water marks; Meiklejohn flames
me a letter about it, which is so complimentary that I
must keep it or get it published in the Monterey Californian.
Some of these days I shall send an exemplaire of
that paper; it is huge.&mdash;Ever your affectionate friend,</p>

my plaintive appeals for correspondence, and
written only once as against God knows how many notes
and notikins of mine&mdash;here goes again. I am now all
alone in Monterey, a real inhabitant, with a box of my
own at the P. O. I have splendid rooms at the doctor&rsquo;s,
where I get coffee in the morning (the doctor is French),
and I mess with another jolly old Frenchman, the stranded
fifty-eight-year-old wreck of a good-hearted, dissipated,
and once wealthy Nantais tradesman. My health goes on
better; as for work, the draft of my book was laid aside
at p. 68 or so; and I have now, by way of change, more
than seventy pages of a novel, a one-volume novel, alas!
to be called either <i>A Chapter in the Experience of Arizona</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>242</span>
<i>Breckonridge</i> or <i>A Vendetta in the West</i>, or a combination of
the two. The scene from Chapter IV. to the end lies in
Monterey and the adjacent country; of course, with my

containing an illegitimate father for piece of resistance.... Ever

<p class="rt"><i>Monterey</i> [<i>November 1879</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MR. HAMERTON</span>,&mdash;Your letter to my father
was forwarded to me by mistake, and by mistake I opened
it. The letter to myself has not yet reached me. This
must explain my own and my father&rsquo;s silence. I shall
write by this or next post to the only friends I have who,
I think, would have an influence, as they are both professors.
I regret exceedingly that I am not in Edinburgh,
as I could perhaps have done more, and I need not tell
you that what I might do for you in the matter of the
election is neither from friendship nor gratitude, but
because you are the only man (I beg your pardon)
worth a damn. I shall write to a third friend, now I
think of it, whose father will have great influence.</p>

<p>I find here (of all places in the world) your <i>Essays on
Art</i>, which I have read with signal interest. I believe I
shall dig an essay of my own out of one of them, for it
set me thinking; if mine could only produce yet another
in reply, we could have the marrow out between us.</p>

<p>I hope, my dear sir, you will not think badly of me for
my long silence. My head has scarce been on my shoulders.
I had scarce recovered from a long fit of useless ill-health
than I was whirled over here double-quick time and
by cheapest conveyance.</p>

<p>I have been since pretty ill, but pick up, though still
somewhat of a mossy ruin. If you would view my countenance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>243</span>
aright, come&mdash;view it by the pale moonlight.
But that is on the mend. I believe I have now a distant
claim to tan.</p>

<p>A letter will be more than welcome in this distant
clime, where I have a box at the post-office&mdash;generally, I
regret to say, empty. Could your recommendation introduce
me to an American publisher? My next book I
should really try to get hold of here, as its interest is international,
and the more I am in this country the more I
understand the weight of your influence. It is pleasant
to be thus most at home abroad, above all, when the
prophet is still not without honour in his own land....</p>

<p>The copy of the Monterey paper here mentioned never came to

<p class="rt"><i>Monterey, 15th November 1879.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;Your letter was to me such a bright
spot that I answer it right away to the prejudice of other
correspondents or -dants (don&rsquo;t know how to spell it)
who have prior claims.... It is the history of our kindnesses
that alone makes this world tolerable. If it were
not for that, for the effect of kind words, kind looks, kind
letters, multiplying, spreading, making one happy through
another and bringing forth benefits, some thirty, some
fifty, some a thousandfold, I should be tempted to think
our life a practical jest in the worst possible spirit. So
your four pages have confirmed my philosophy as well
as consoled my heart in these ill hours.</p>

<p>Yes, you are right; Monterey is a pleasant place; but
I see I can write no more to-night. I am tired and sad,
and being already in bed, have no more to do but turn
out the light.&mdash;Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p>I try it again by daylight. Once more in bed however;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>244</span>
for to-day it is <i>mucho frio, as</i> we Spaniards say;
and I had no other means of keeping warm for my work.
I have done a good spell, 9&frac12; foolscap pages; at least 8 of
Cornhill; ah, if I thought that I could get eight guineas
for it. My trouble is that I am all too ambitious just
now. A book whereof 70 out of 120 are scrolled. A novel
whereof 85 out of, say 140, are pretty well nigh done. A
short story of 50 pp., which shall be finished to-morrow,
or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why. This may bring in a lot of
money: but I dread to think that it is all on three chances.
If the three were to fail, I am in a bog. The novel is
called <i>A Vendetta in the West</i>. I see I am in a grasping,
dismal humour, and should, as we Americans put it,
quit writing. In truth, I am so haunted by anxieties
that one or other is sure to come up in all that I write.</p>

<p>I will send you herewith a Monterey paper where the
works of R. L. S. appear, nor only that, but all my life
on studying the advertisements will become clear. I
lodge with Dr. Heintz; take my meals with Simoneau;
have been only two days ago shaved by the tonsorial
artist Michaels; drink daily at the Bohemia saloon; get
my daily paper from Hadsell&rsquo;s; was stood a drink to-day
by Albano Rodriguez; in short, there is scarce a person
advertised in that paper but I know him, and I may add
scarce a person in Monterey but is there advertised. The
paper is the marrow of the place. Its bones&mdash;pooh, I am
tired of writing so sillily.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Monterey, December 1879.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="sc">To-day</span>, my dear Colvin, I send you the first part of
the <i>Amateur Emigrant</i>, 71 pp., by far the longest and
the best of the whole. It is not a monument of eloquence;
indeed, I have sought to be prosaic in view of the nature
of the subject; but I almost think it is interesting.</p>

<p>Whatever is done about any book publication, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>245</span>
things remember: I must keep a royalty; and, second, I
must have all my books advertised, in the French manner,
on the leaf opposite the title. I know from my own
experience how much good this does an author with book
<i>buyers</i>.</p>

<p>The entire <i>A. E.</i> will be a little longer than the two
others, but not very much. Here and there, I fancy, you
will laugh as you read it; but it seems to me rather a
<i>clever</i> book than anything else: the book of a man, that
is, who has paid a great deal of attention to contemporary
life, and not through the newspapers.</p>

<p>I have never seen my <i>Burns!</i> the darling of my heart!
I await your promised letter. Papers, magazines, articles
by friends; reviews of myself, all would be very welcome.
I am reporter for the Monterey Californian, at a salary
of two dollars a week! <i>Comment trouvez-vous ça?</i> I am
also in a conspiracy with the American editor, a French
restaurant-man, and an Italian fisherman against the
Padre. The enclosed poster is my last literary appearance.
It was put up to the number of 200 exemplaires
at the witching hour; and they were almost all destroyed
by eight in the morning. But I think the nickname will
stick. <i>Dos Reales; deux réaux</i>; two bits; twenty-five
cents; about a shilling; but in practice it is worth from
ninepence to threepence: thus two glasses of beer would
cost two bits. The Italian fisherman, an old Garibaldian,
is a splendid fellow.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR WEG</span>,&mdash;I received your book last night as
I lay abed with a pleurisy, the result, I fear, of overwork,
gradual decline of appetite, etc. You know what a
wooden-hearted curmudgeon I am about contemporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>246</span>
verse. I like none of it, except some of my own. (I
look back on that sentence with pleasure; it comes from
an honest heart.) Hence you will be kind enough to
take this from me in a kindly spirit; the piece &ldquo;To my
daughter&rdquo; is delicious. And yet even here I am going
to pick holes. I am a <i>beastly</i> curmudgeon. It is the last
verse. &ldquo;Newly budded&rdquo; is off the venue; and haven&rsquo;t
you gone ahead to make a poetry daybreak instead of
sticking to your muttons, and comparing with the mysterious
light of stars the plain, friendly, perspicuous,
human day? But this is to be a beast. The little poem
is eminently pleasant, human, and original.</p>

<p>I have read nearly the whole volume, and shall read
it nearly all over again; you have no rivals!</p>

<p>Bancroft&rsquo;s <i>History of the United States</i>, even in a
centenary edition, is essentially heavy fare; a little goes
a long way; I respect Bancroft, but I do not love him;
he has moments when he feels himself inspired to open
up his improvisations upon universal history and the
designs of God; but I flatter myself I am more nearly
acquainted with the latter than Mr. Bancroft. A man,
in the words of my Plymouth Brother, &ldquo;who knows the
Lord,&rdquo; must needs, from time to time, write less emphatically.
It is a fetter dance to the music of minute guns&mdash;not
at sea, but in a region not a thousand miles from the
Sahara. Still, I am half-way through volume three, and
shall count myself unworthy of the name of an Englishman
if I do not see the back of volume six. The countryman
of Livingstone, Burton, Speke, Drake, Cook, etc.!</p>

<p>I have been sweated not only out of my pleuritic fever,
but out of all my eating cares, and the better part of my
brains (strange coincidence!), by aconite. I have that
peculiar and delicious sense of being born again in an
expurgated edition which belongs to convalescence. It
will not be for long; I hear the breakers roar; I shall
be steering head first for another rapid before many days;
<i>nitor aquis</i>, said a certain Eton boy, translating for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>247</span>
sins a part of the <i>Inland Voyage</i> into Latin elegiacs; and
from the hour I saw it, or rather a friend of mine, the
admirable Jenkin, saw and recognised its absurd appropriateness,
I took it for my device in life. I am going
for thirty now; and unless I can snatch a little rest before
long, I have, I may tell you in confidence, no hope of
seeing thirty-one. My health began to break last winter,
and has given me but fitful times since then. This pleurisy,
though but a slight affair in itself, was a huge disappointment
to me, and marked an epoch. To start a pleurisy
about nothing, while leading a dull, regular life in a mild
climate, was not my habit in past days; and it is six
years, all but a few months, since I was obliged to spend
twenty-four hours in bed. I may be wrong, but if the
niting is to continue, I believe I must go. It is a pity
in one sense, for I believe the class of work I <i>might</i> yet
give out is better and more real and solid than people
fancy. But death is no bad friend; a few aches and
gasps, and we are done; like the truant child, I am beginning
to grow weary and timid in this big jostling city,
and could run to my nurse, even although she should
have to whip me before putting me to bed.</p>

<p>Will you kiss your little daughter from me, and tell
her that her father has written a delightful poem about
her? Remember me, please, to Mrs. Gosse, to Middlemore,
to whom some of these days I will write, to &mdash;&mdash;,

<p>Here is my scheme. Henley already proposed that
Caldecott should illustrate <i>Will o&rsquo; the Mill</i>. The <i>Guitar</i>
is still more suited to him; he should make delicious
things for that. And though the <i>Lie</i> is not much in the
way for pictures, I should like to see my dear Admiral
in the flesh. I love the Admiral; I give my head, that
man&rsquo;s alive. As for the other two they need not be illustrated
at all unless he likes.</p>

<p>Is this a dream altogether? I would if necessary ask
nothing down for the stories, and only a small royalty
but to begin <i>from the first copy sold</i>.</p>

<p>I hate myself for being always on business. But I
cannot help my fears and anxieties about money; even
if all came well, it would be many a long day before we
could afford to leave this coast. Is it true that the <i>Donkey</i>
is in a second edition? That should bring some money,
too, ere long, though not much I dare say. You will see
the <i>Guitar</i> is made for Caldecott; moreover it&rsquo;s a little
thing I like. I am no lover of either of the things in
Temple Bar; but they will make up the volume, and
perhaps others may like them better than I do. They
say republished stories do not sell. Well, that is why I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>249</span>
am in a hurry to get this out. The public must be educated
to buy mine or I shall never make a cent. I have heaps
of short stories in view. The next volume will probably
be called <i>Stories</i> or A <i>Story-Book</i>, and contain quite a
different lot: <i>The Pavilion on the Links</i>: <i>Professor Rensselaer</i>:
<i>The Dead Man&rsquo;s Letter</i>: <i>The Wild Man of the

<p>1. You are wrong about the <i>Lie</i>, from choosing a wrong
standard. Compare it with my former stories, not with

Wilkie Collins; and where will you find anything half
or a tenth part as good as the Admiral, or even Dick, or
even the Squire, or even Esther. If you had thought of
that, you would have complimented me for advance. But
you were not quite sincere with yourself: you were seeking
arguments to make me devote myself to plays, unbeknown,
of course, to yourself.</p>

<p>2. Plays, dear boy, are madness for me just now.
The best play is hopeless before six months, and more
likely eighteen for outsiders like you and me. And understand
me, I have to get money <i>soon</i>, or it has no further
interest for me; I am nearly through my capital; with
what pluck I can muster against great anxieties and in
a very shattered state of health, I am trying to do things
that will bring in money soon; and I could not, if I were
not mad, step out of my way to work at what might perhaps
bring me in more but months ahead. Journalism,
you know well, is not my forte; yet if I could only get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>250</span>
a roving commission from a paper, I should leap at it
and send them goodish (no more than that) goodish stuff.</p>

<p>As for my poor literature, dear Henley, you must
expect for a time to find it worse and worse. Perhaps,
if God favours me a little at last, it will pick up again.
Now I am fighting with both hands, a hard battle, and
my work, while it will be as good as I can make it, will
probably be worth twopence. If you despised the <i>Donkey</i>,
dear boy, you should have told me so at the time, not
reserved it for a sudden revelation just now when I am
down in health, wealth, and fortune. But I am glad you
have said so at last. Never, please, delay such confidences
any more. If they come quickly, they are a help; if they
come after long silence, they feel almost like a taunt.</p>

<p>Now, to read all this, any one would think you had
written unkindly, which is not so, as God who made us
knows. But I wished to put myself right ere I went on
to state myself. Nothing has come but the volume of
Labiche; the <i>Burns</i> I have now given up; the P.O.
authorities plainly regard it as contraband; make no
further efforts in that direction. But, please, if anything
else of mine appears, <i>see that my people have a copy</i>. I
hoped and supposed my own copy would go as usual to
the old address, and, let me use Scotch, I was fair affrontit
when I found this had not been done.</p>

<p>You have not told me how you are and I heard you
had not been well. Please remedy this.</p>

<p>The end of life? Yes, Henley, I can tell you what
that is. How old are all truths, and yet how far from
commonplace; old, strange, and inexplicable, like the
Sphinx. So I learn day by day the value and high doctrinality
of suffering. Let me suffer always; not more than
I am able to bear, for that makes a man mad, as hunger
drives the wolf to sally from the forest; but still to suffer
some, and never to sink up to my eyes in comfort and
grow dead in virtues and respectability. I am a bad
man by nature, I suppose; but I cannot be good without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>251</span>
suffering a little. And the end of life, you will ask? The
pleasurable death of self: a thing not to be attained,
because it is a thing belonging to Heaven. All this apropos
of that good, weak, feverish, fine spirit, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;. We
have traits in common; we have almost the same strength
and weakness intermingled; and if I had not come through
a very hot crucible, I should be just as feverish. My
sufferings have been healthier than his; mine have been
always a choice, where a man could be manly; his have
been so too, if he knew it, but were not so upon the face;
hence a morbid strain, which his wounded vanity has
helped to embitter.</p>

<p>I wonder why I scratch every one to-day. And I
believe it is because I am conscious of so much truth in
your strictures on my damned stuff. I don&rsquo;t care; there
is something in me worth saying, though I can&rsquo;t find what
it is just yet; and ere I die, if I do not die too fast, I
shall write something worth the boards, which with scarce
an exception I have not yet done. At the same time,
dear boy, in a matter of vastly more importance than
Opera Omnia Ludovici Stevenson, I mean my life, I
have not been a perfect cad; God help me to be less and
less so as the days go on.</p>

<p>The <i>Emigrant</i> is not good, and will never do for P.M.G.,
though it must have a kind of rude interest.</p>

<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<p class="rt"><i>608 Bush Street, San Francisco</i>  [<i>December 26, 1879</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I am now writing to you in a café
waiting for some music to begin. For four days I have
spoken to no one but to my landlady or landlord or to
restaurant waiters. This is not a gay way to pass Christmas,
is it? and I must own the guts are a little knocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>252</span>
out of me. If I could work, I could worry through better.
But I have no style at command for the moment, with
the second part of the <i>Emigrant</i>, the last of the novel,
the essay on Thoreau, and God knows all, waiting for
me. But I trust something can be done with the first
part, or, by God, I&rsquo;ll starve here....<a name="FnAnchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a></p>

<p>O Colvin, you don&rsquo;t know how much good I have
done myself. I feared to think this out by myself. I
have made a base use of you, and it comes out so much
better than I had dreamed. But I have to stick to work
now; and here&rsquo;s December gone pretty near useless.
But, Lord love you, October and November saw a great
harvest. It might have affected the price of paper on
the Pacific coast. As for ink, they haven&rsquo;t any, not what
I call ink; only stuff to write cookery-books with, or
the works of Hayley, or the pallid perambulations of the&mdash;I
can find nobody to beat Hayley. I like good, knock-me-down
black-strap to write with; that makes a mark
and done with it.&mdash;By the way, I have tried to read the
<i>Spectator</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> which they all say I imitate, and&mdash;it&rsquo;s very
wrong of me, I know&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s all very fine,
you know, and all that, but it&rsquo;s vapid. They have just
played the overture to <i>Norma</i>, and I know it&rsquo;s a good one,
for I bitterly wanted the opera to go on; I had just got
thoroughly interested&mdash;and then no curtain to rise.</p>

<p>I have written myself into a kind of spirits, bless your
dear heart, by your leave. But this is wild work for me,
nearly nine and me not back! What will Mrs. Carson
think of me! Quite a night-hawk, I do declare. You
are the worst correspondent in the world&mdash;no, not that,
Henley is that&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know, I leave the pair of
you to him that made you&mdash;surely with small attention.
But here&rsquo;s my service, and I&rsquo;ll away home to my den O!
much the better for this crack, Professor Colvin.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>608 Bush Street, San Francisco</i>
[<i>January 10, 1880</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;This is a circular letter to tell my
estate fully. You have no right to it, being the worst
of correspondents; but I wish to efface the impression
of my last, so to you it goes.</p>

<p>Any time between eight and half-past nine in the
morning, a slender gentleman in an ulster, with a volume
buttoned into the breast of it, may be observed leaving
No. 608 Bush and descending Powell with an active step.
The gentleman is R. L. S.; the volume relates to Benjamin
Franklin, on whom he meditates one of his charming
essays. He descends Powell, crosses Market, and
descends in Sixth on a branch of the original Pine Street
Coffee House, no less; I believe he would be capable of
going to the original itself, if he could only find it. In
the branch he seats himself at a table covered with wax-cloth,
and a pampered menial, of High-Dutch extraction
and, indeed, as yet only partially extracted, lays before
him a cup of coffee, a roll and a pat of butter, all, to quote
the deity, very good. A while ago and R. L. S. used
to find the supply of butter insufficient; but he has now
learned the art to exactitude, and butter and roll expire
at the same moment. For this refection he pays ten cents,
or five pence sterling (£0, 0s. 5d.).</p>

<p>Half an hour later, the inhabitants of Bush Street
observe the same slender gentleman armed, like George
Washington, with his little hatchet, splitting, kindling,
and breaking coal for his fire. He does this quasi-publicly
upon the window-sill; but this is not to be attributed to
any love of notoriety, though he is indeed vain of his
prowess with the hatchet (which he persists in calling an
axe), and daily surprised at the perpetuation of his fingers.
The reason is this: that the sill is a strong, supporting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>254</span>
beam, and that blows of the same emphasis in other parts
of his room might knock the entire shanty into hell.
Thenceforth, for from three to four hours, he is engaged
darkly with an ink bottle. Yet he is not blacking his boots,
for the only pair that he possesses are innocent of lustre
and wear the natural hue of the material turned up with
caked and venerable slush. The youngest child of his
landlady remarks several times a day, as this strange
occupant enters or quits the house, &ldquo;Dere&rsquo;s de author.&rdquo;
Can it be that this bright-haired innocent has found the
true clue to the mystery? The being in question is, at
least, poor enough to belong to that honourable craft.</p>

<p>His next appearance is at the restaurant of one Donadieu,
in Bush Street, between Dupont and Kearney, where
a copious meal, half a bottle of wine, coffee and brandy
may be procured for the sum of four bits, <i>alias</i> fifty cents,
£0, 2s. 2d. sterling. The wine is put down in a whole
bottleful, and it is strange and painful to observe the
greed with which the gentleman in question seeks to
secure the last drop of his allotted half, and the scrupulousness
with which he seeks to avoid taking the first drop
of the other. This is partly explained by the fact that
if he were to go over the mark&mdash;bang would go a tenpence.
He is again armed with a book, but his best
friends will learn with pain that he seems at this hour to
have deserted the more serious studies of the morning.
When last observed, he was studying with apparent zest
the exploits of one Rocambole by the late Viscomte
Ponson du Terrail. This work, originally of prodigious
dimensions, he had cut into liths or thicknesses apparently
for convenience of carriage.</p>

<p>Then the being walks, where is not certain. But by
about half-past four, a light beams from the windows of
608 Bush, and he may be observed sometimes engaged
in correspondence, sometimes once again plunged in the
mysterious rites of the forenoon. About six he returns to
the Branch Original, where he once more imbrues himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>255</span>
to the worth of fivepence in coffee and roll. The evening
is devoted to writing and reading, and by eleven or half-past
darkness closes over this weird and truculent existence.</p>

<p>As for coin, you see I don&rsquo;t spend much, only you and
Henley both seem to think my work rather bosh nowadays,
and I do want to make as much as I was making,
that is £200; if I can do that, I can swim: last year with
my ill health I touched only £109; that would not do,
I could not fight it through on that; but on £200, as
I say, I am good for the world, and can even in this quiet
way save a little, and that I must do. The worst is my
health; it is suspected I had an ague chill yesterday; I
shall know by to-morrow, and you know if I am to be
laid down with ague the game is pretty well lost. But
I don&rsquo;t know; I managed to write a good deal down in
Monterey, when I was pretty sickly most of the time,
and, by God, I&rsquo;ll try, ague and all. I have to ask you
frankly, when you write, to give me any good news you
can, and chat a little, but <i>just in the meantime</i>, give me
no bad. If I could get <i>Thoreau</i>, <i>Emigrant</i> and <i>Vendetta</i>
all finished and out of my hand, I should feel like a man
who had made half a year&rsquo;s income in a half year; but until
the two last are <i>finished</i>, you see, they don&rsquo;t fairly count.</p>

<p>I am afraid I bore you sadly with this perpetual talk
about my affairs; I will try and stow it; but you see, it
touches me nearly. I&rsquo;m the miser in earnest now: last
night, when I felt so ill, the supposed ague chill, it seemed
strange not to be able to afford a drink. I would have
walked half a mile, tired as I felt, for a brandy and soda.&mdash;Ever
yours,</p>

<p class="rt"><i>608 Bush Street,
San Francisco, January 1880.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;You have got a letter ahead of
me, owing to the Alpine accumulation of ill news I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>256</span>
to stagger under. I will stand no complaints of my correspondence
from England, I having written near half as
many letters again as I have received.</p>

<p>Do not damp me about my work; <i>qu&rsquo;elle soit bonne ou
mauvaise</i>, it has to be done. You know the wolf is at
the door, and I have been seriously ill. I am now at
Thoreau. I almost blame myself for persevering in anything
so difficult under the circumstances: but it may
set me up again in style, which is the great point. I
have now £80 in the world and two houses to keep up
for an indefinite period. It is odd to be on so strict a
regimen; it is a week for instance since I have bought
myself a drink, and unless times change, I do not suppose
I shall ever buy myself another. The health improves.
The Pied Piper is an idea; it shall have my thoughts,
and so shall you. The character of the P. P. would be
highly comic, I seem to see. Had you looked at the
<i>Pavilion</i>, I do not think you would have sent it to Stephen;
&rsquo;tis a mere story, and has no higher pretension: Dibbs
is its name, I wish it was its nature also. The <i>Vendetta,</i>
at which you ignorantly puff out your lips, is a real novel,
though not a good one. As soon as I have found strength
to finish the <i>Emigrant</i>, I shall also finish the <i>Vend.</i> and
draw a breath&mdash;I wish I could say, &ldquo;and draw a cheque.&rdquo;
My spirits have risen <i>contra fortunam</i>; I will fight this
out, and conquer. You are all anxious to have me home
in a hurry. There are two or three objections to that;
but I shall instruct you more at large when I have time,
for to-day I am hunted, having a pile of letters before
me. Yet it is already drawing into dusk.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p>The Dook de Karneel (= Cornhill) and Marky de Stephen is
of course Mr. Leslie Stephen. The &ldquo;blood and thunder&rdquo; is <i>The
Pavilion on the Links. Hester Noble</i> and <i>Don Juan</i> were the titles
of two plays planned and begun with W. E. Henley the previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>257</span>
winter. They were never finished. The French novels mentioned
are by Joseph Méry. The <i>Dialogue on Character and Destiny</i> still
exists in a fragmentary condition. George the Pieman is a character
in <i>Deacon Brodie</i>.</p>

I <i>thought</i> it had points; now, I know it. And I&rsquo;m to see
a proof once more! O Glory Hallelujah, how beautiful
is proof, And how distressed that author man who dwells
too far aloof. His favourite words he always finds his

pine for the <i>Deacon</i>, for proofs of the <i>Pavilion</i>&mdash;O and

edition of the <i>Donkey</i> was a false alarm, which I conclude
from hearing no more.</p>

<p>I have mighty little to say, dear boy, to seem worth
2&frac12;d. I have thought of the Piper, but he does not seem
to come as yet; I get him too metaphysical. I shall
make a shot for <i>Hester</i>, as soon as I have finished the
<i>Emigrant</i> and the <i>Vendetta</i> and perhaps my <i>Dialogue on
Character and Destiny</i>. Hester and Don Juan are the
two that smile on me; but I will touch nothing in the
shape of a play until I have made my year&rsquo;s income sure.
You understand, and you see that I am right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>258</span></p>

<p>I have read <i>M. Auguste</i> and the <i>Crime inconnu</i>, being
now abonné to a library, and found them very readable,
highly ingenious, and so French that I could not keep
my gravity. The <i>Damned Ones of the Indies</i> now occupy
my attention; I have myself already damned them repeatedly.
I am, as you know, the original person the

slow, I am rootedly tenacious. Do not despair. <i>Hester</i>

<p>With reference to the following, it must be explained that the first
draft of the first part of the <i>Amateur Emigrant</i>, when it reached
me about Christmas, had seemed to me, compared to his previous
travel papers, a somewhat wordy and spiritless record of squalid
experiences, little likely to advance his still only half-established
reputation; and I had written to him to that effect, inopportunely
enough, with a fuller measure even than usual of the frankness
which always marked our intercourse.</p>

<p class="rt"><i>608 Bush Street, San Francisco,
California</i> [<i>January 1880</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I received this morning your long
letter from Paris. Well, God&rsquo;s will be done; if it&rsquo;s dull,
it&rsquo;s dull; it was a fair fight, and it&rsquo;s lost, and there&rsquo;s an
end. But, fortunately, dulness is not a fault the public
hates; perhaps they may like this vein of dulness. If
they don&rsquo;t, damn them, we&rsquo;ll try them with another. I
sat down on the back of your letter, and wrote twelve
Cornhill pages this day as ever was of that same despised
<i>Emigrant</i>; so you see my moral courage has not gone
down with my intellect. Only, frankly, Colvin, do you
think it a good plan to be so eminently descriptive, and
even eloquent in dispraise? You rolled such a lot of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>259</span>
polysyllables over me that a better man than I might
have been disheartened.&mdash;However, I was not, as you
see, and am not. The <i>Emigrant</i> shall be finished and
leave in the course of next week. And then, I&rsquo;ll stick
to stories. I am not frightened. I know my mind is
changing; I have been telling you so for long; and I
suppose I am fumbling for the new vein. Well, I&rsquo;ll find it.</p>

<p>The <i>Vendetta</i> you will not much like, I dare say: and
that must be finished next; but I&rsquo;ll knock you with <i>The
Forest State: A Romance</i>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m vexed about my letters; I know it is painful to get
these unsatisfactory things; but at least I have written
often enough. And not one soul ever gives me any <i>news,</i>
about people or things; everybody writes me sermons;
it&rsquo;s good for me, but hardly the food necessary for a man
who lives all alone on forty-five cents a day, and sometimes
less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy
thoughts. If one of you could write me a letter with a
jest in it, a letter like what is written to real people in
this world&mdash;I am still flesh and blood&mdash;I should enjoy
it. Simpson did, the other day, and it did me as much
good as a bottle of wine. A lonely man gets to feel like
a pariah after awhile&mdash;or no, not that, but like a saint
and martyr, or a kind of macerated clergyman with
pebbles in his boots, a pillared Simeon, I&rsquo;m damned if I
know what, but, man alive, I want gossip.</p>

<p>My health is better, my spirits steadier, I am not the
least cast down. If the <i>Emigrant</i> was a failure, the
<i>Pavilion</i>, by your leave, was not: it was a story quite
adequately and rightly done, I contend; and when I
find Stephen, for whom certainly I did not mean it, taking
it in, I am better pleased with it than before. I know
I shall do better work than ever I have done before; but,
mind you, it will not be like it. My sympathies and
interests are changed. There shall be no more books of
travel for me. I care for nothing but the moral and the
dramatic, not a jot for the picturesque or the beautiful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>260</span>
other than about people. It bored me hellishly to write
the <i>Emigrant</i>; well, it&rsquo;s going to bore others to read it;
that&rsquo;s only fair.</p>

<p>I should also write to others; but indeed I am jack-tired,
and must go to bed to a French novel to compose
myself for slumber.&mdash;Ever your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>


<p class="to">To Edmund Gosse</p>

<p class="rt"><i>608 Bush Street, San Francisco,
California, Jan. 23, 1880.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR AND KIND WEG</span>,&mdash;It was a lesson in philosophy
that would have moved a bear, to receive your
letter in my present temper. For I am now well and
well at my ease, both by comparison. First, my health
has turned a corner; it was not consumption this time,
though consumption it has to be some time, as all my
kind friends sing to me, day in, day out. Consumption!
how I hate that word; yet it can sound innocent, as, <i>e.g.</i>,
consumption of military stores. What was wrong with
me, apart from colds and little pleuritic flea-bites, was a
lingering malaria; and that is now greatly overcome, I
eat once more, which is a great amusement and, they
say, good for the health. Second, many of the thunderclouds
that were overhanging me when last I wrote, have
silently stolen away like Longfellow&rsquo;s Arabs: and I am
now engaged to be married to the woman whom I have
loved for three years and a half. I do not yet know
when the marriage can come off; for there are many
reasons for delay. But as few people before marriage
have known each other so long or made more trials of
each other&rsquo;s tenderness and constancy, I permit myself
to hope some quiet at the end of all. At least I will boast
myself so far; I do not think many wives are better
loved than mine will be. Third and last, in the order
of what has changed my feelings, my people have cast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>261</span>
me off, and so that thundercloud, as you may almost say,
has overblown. You know more than most people whether
or not I loved my father.<a name="FnAnchor_27" href="#Footnote_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> These things are sad; nor
can any man forgive himself for bringing them about;
yet they are easier to meet in fact than by anticipation.
I almost trembled whether I was doing right, until I
was fairly summoned; then, when I found that I was
not shaken one jot, that I could grieve, that I could sharply
blame myself, for the past, and yet never hesitate one
second as to my conduct in the future, I believed my
cause was just and I leave it with the Lord. I certainly
look for no reward, nor any abiding city either here or
hereafter, but I please myself with hoping that my father
will not always think so badly of my conduct nor so very
slightingly of my affection as he does at present.</p>

<p>You may now understand that the quiet economical
citizen of San Francisco who now addresses you, a bonhomme
given to cheap living, early to bed though scarce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>262</span>
early to rise in proportion (que diable! let us have style,
anyway), busied with his little bits of books and essays
and with a fair hope for the future, is no longer the same
desponding, invalid son of a doubt and an apprehension
who last wrote to you from Monterey. I am none the
less warmly obliged to you and Mrs. Gosse for your good
words. I suppose that I am the devil (hearing it so
often), but I am not ungrateful. Only please, Weg, do
not talk of genius about me; I do not think I want for
a certain talent, but I am heartily persuaded I have none
of the other commodity; so let that stick to the wall:
you only shame me by such friendly exaggerations.</p>

<p>When shall I be married? When shall I be able to
return to England? When shall I join the good and
blessed in a forced march upon the New Jerusalem? That
is what I know not in any degree; some of them, let us
hope, will come early, some after a judicious interval. I
have three little strangers knocking at the door of Leslie
Stephen: <i>The Pavilion on the Links</i>, a blood and thunder
story, <i>accepted</i>; <i>Yoshida Torajiro</i>, a paper on a Japanese
hero who will warm your blood, <i>postulant</i>; and <i>Henry
David Thoreau</i>: <i>his character and opinions</i>&mdash;postulant
also. I give you these hints knowing you to love the best
literature, that you may keep an eye at the mast-head for
these little tit-bits. Write again, and soon, and at greater

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR CHARLES</span>,&mdash;I have to drop from a 50 cent to
a 25 cent dinner; to-day begins my fall. That brings
down my outlay in food and drink to 45 cents or 1s. 10&frac12;d.
per day. How are the mighty fallen! Luckily, this is
such a cheap place for food; I used to pay as much as
that for my first breakfast in the Savile in the grand old
palmy days of yore. I regret nothing, and do not even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>263</span>
dislike these straits, though the flesh will rebel on occasion.
It is to-day bitter cold, after weeks of lovely warm
weather, and I am all in a chitter. I am about to issue
for my little shilling and halfpenny meal, taken in the
middle of the day, the poor man&rsquo;s hour; and I shall eat
and drink to your prosperity.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>One day at the Savile Club, Stevenson, hearing a certain laugh,
cried out that he must know the laugher, who turned out to be a
fellow-countryman, the late John Meiklejohn, the well-known
educational authority and professor at St. Andrews University.
Stevenson introduced himself, and the two became firm friends.
Allusion was made a few pages back to a letter from Professor
Meiklejohn about the <i>Burns</i> essay.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>608 Bush Street, San Francisco,
California, Feb. 1st, 1880.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MEIKLEJOHN</span>,&mdash;You must think me a thankless
fellow by this time; but if you knew how harassed
and how sick I had been, and how I have twice begun to
write to you already, you might condescend to forgive
the puir gangrel body. To tell you what I have been
doing, thinking, and coming through these six or seven
months would exhilarate nobody: least of all me. <i>Infandum
jubes</i>, so I hope you won&rsquo;t. I have done a great
deal of work, but perhaps my health of mind and body
should not let me expect much from what I have done.
At least I have turned the corner; my feet are on the
rock again, I believe, and I shall continue to pour forth
pure and wholesome literature for the masses as per
invoice.</p>

<p>I am glad you liked <i>Burns</i>; I think it is the best thing
I ever did. Did not the national vanity exclaim? Do
you know what Shairp thought? I think I let him down
gently, did I not?</p>

<p>I have done a <i>Thoreau</i>, which I hope you may like,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>264</span>
though I have a feeling that perhaps it might be better.
Please look out for a little paper called <i>Yoshida Torajiro</i>,
which, I hope, will appear in Cornhill ere very long;
the subject, at least, will interest you. I am to appear
in the same magazine with a real &ldquo;blood and bones in
the name of God&rdquo; story. Why Stephen took it, is to
me a mystery; anyhow, it was fun to write, and if you
can interest a person for an hour and a half, you have
not been idle. When I suffer in mind, stories are my
refuge; I take them like opium; and I consider one who
writes them as a sort of doctor of the mind. And frankly,
Meiklejohn, it is not Shakespeare we take to, when we are
in a hot corner; nor, certainly, George Eliot&mdash;no, nor
even Balzac. It is Charles Reade, or old Dumas, or the
Arabian Nights, or the best of Walter Scott; it is stories
we want, not the high poetic function which represents
the world; we are then like the Asiatic with his improvisatore
or the middle-agee with his trouvère. We want
incident, interest, action: to the devil with your philosophy.
When we are well again, and have an easy mind,
we shall peruse your important work; but what we want
now is a drug. So I, when I am ready to go beside myself,
stick my head into a story-book, as the ostrich with
her bush; let fate and fortune meantime belabour my
posteriors at their will.</p>

<p>I have not seen the Spectator article; nobody sent it
to me. If you had an old copy lying by you, you would
be very good to despatch it to me. A little abuse from
my grandmamma would do me good in health, if not in
morals.</p>

<p>This is merely to shake hands with you and give you
the top of the morning in 1880. But I look to be answered;
and then I shall promise to answer in return. For I am
now, so far as that can be in this world, my own man
again, and when I have heard from you, I shall be able to
write more naturally and at length.</p>

<p>At least, my dear Meiklejohn, I hope you will believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>265</span>
in the sincerely warm and friendly regard in which I hold
you, and the pleasure with which I look forward, not only
to hearing from you shortly, but to seeing you again in
the flesh with another good luncheon and good talk. Tell
me when you don&rsquo;t like my work.&mdash;Your friend,</p>

<p class="to">To W. E. Henley</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The essays here mentioned on Benjamin Franklin and William
Penn were projects long cherished but in the end abandoned: <i>The
Forest State</i> came to maturity three years later as <i>Prince Otto</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>608 Bush Street, San Francisco,
Cal., February 1880.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;Before my work or anything I sit
down to answer your long and kind letter.</p>

<p>I am well, cheerful, busy, hopeful; I cannot be knocked
down; I do not mind about the <i>Emigrant</i>. I never thought
it a masterpiece. It was written to sell, and I believe it
will sell; and if it does not, the next will. You need not
be uneasy about my work; I am only beginning to see
my true method.</p>

<p>(1) As to <i>Studies</i>. There are two more already gone
to Stephen. <i>Yoshida Torajiro</i>, which I think temperate
and adequate; and <i>Thoreau</i>, which will want a really
Balzacian effort over the proofs. But I want <i>Benjamin
Franklin and the Art of Virtue</i> to follow; and perhaps
also <i>William Penn</i>, but this last may be perhaps delayed
for another volume&mdash;I think not, though. The <i>Studies</i>
will be an intelligent volume, and in their latter numbers
more like what I mean to be my style, or I mean what
my style means to be, for I am passive. (2) The Essays.
Good news indeed. I think <i>Ordered South</i> must be thrown
in. It always swells the volume, and it will never find
a more appropriate place. It was May 1874, Macmillan,
I believe. (3) Plays. I did not understand you meant
to try the draft. I shall make you a full scenario as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>266</span>
soon as the <i>Emigrant</i> is done. (4) <i>Emigrant.</i> He shall
be sent off next week. (5) Stories. You need not be
alarmed that I am going to imitate Meredith. You know
I was a story-teller ingrain; did not that reassure you?
The <i>Vendetta</i>, which falls next to be finished, is not entirely
pleasant. But it has points. <i>The Forest State</i> or <i>The
Greenwood State: A Romance</i>, is another pair of shoes.
It is my old Semiramis, our half-seen Duke and Duchess,
which suddenly sprang into sunshine clearness as a story
the other day. The kind, happy <i>dénouement</i> is unfortunately
absolutely undramatic, which will be our only
trouble in quarrying out the play. I mean we shall quarry
from it. <i>Characters</i>&mdash;Otto Frederick John, hereditary
Prince of Grünwald; Amelia Seraphina, Princess; Conrad,
Baron Gondremarck, Prime Minister; Cancellarius
Greisengesang; Killian Gottesacker, Steward of the
River Farm; Ottilie, his daughter; the Countess von
Rosen. Seven in all. A brave story, I swear; and a
brave play too, if we can find the trick to make the end.
The play, I fear, will have to end darkly, and that spoils
the quality as I now see it of a kind of crockery, eighteenth
century, high-life-below-stairs life, breaking up like ice
in spring before the nature and the certain modicum of
manhood of my poor, clever, feather-headed Prince,
whom I love already. I see Seraphina too. Gondremarck
is not quite so clear. The Countess von Rosen, I
have; I&rsquo;ll never tell you who she is; it&rsquo;s a secret; but
I have known the countess; well, I will tell you; it&rsquo;s my
old Russian friend, Madame Zassetsky. Certain scenes
are, in conception, the best I have ever made, except for
<i>Hester Noble</i>. Those at the end, Von Rosen and the
Princess, the Prince and Princess, and the Princess and
Gondremarck, as I now see them from here, should be
nuts, Henley, nuts. It irks me not to go to them straight.
But the <i>Emigrant</i> stops the way; then a reassured
scenario for <i>Hester</i>; then the <i>Vendetta</i>; then two (or
three) essays&mdash;<i>Benjamin Franklin</i>, <i>Thoughts on Literature</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>267</span>
<i>as an Art</i>, <i>Dialogue on Character and Destiny between two
Puppets</i>, <i>The Human Compromise</i>; and then, at length&mdash;come
to me, my Prince. O Lord, it&rsquo;s going to be courtly!
And there is not an ugly person nor an ugly scene in it.
The <i>Slate</i> both Fanny and I have damned utterly; it is
too morbid, ugly, and unkind; better starvation.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I had written proposing that a collected volume of his short
stories should be published with illustrations by Caldecott. At
the end of this letter occurs his first allusion to his now famous
<i>Requiem</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>608 Bush Street,
San Francisco, February 1880.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I received a very nice letter from
you with two enclosures. I am still unable to finish the
<i>Emigrant</i>, although there are only some fifteen pages to
do. The <i>Vendetta</i> is, I am afraid, scarce Fortnightly
form, though after the <i>Pavilion</i> being taken by Stephen,
I am truly at sea about all such matters. I dare say my
<i>Prince of Grünewald</i>&mdash;the name still uncertain&mdash;would be
good enough for anything if I could but get it done: I
believe that to be a really good story. The <i>Vendetta</i> is
somewhat cheap in motive; very rum and unlike the
present kind of novels both for good and evil in writing;
and on the whole, only remarkable for the heroine&rsquo;s
character, and that I believe to be in it.</p>

<p>I am not well at all. But hope to be better. You
know I have been hawked to death these last months.
And then I lived too low, I fear; and any way I have
got pretty low and out at elbows in health. I wish I
could say better,&mdash;but I cannot. With a constitution
like mine, you never know&mdash;to-morrow I may be carrying
topgallant sails again: but just at present I am scraping
along with a jurymast and a kind of amateur rudder.
Truly I have some misery, as things go; but these things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>268</span>
are mere detail. However, I do not want to <i>crever</i>, <i>claquer</i>,
and cave in just when I have a chance of some happiness;
nor do I mean to. All the same, I am more and
more in a difficulty how to move every day. What a
day or an hour might bring forth, God forbid that I
should prophesy. Certainly, do what you like about the
stories; <i>Will o&rsquo; the Mill</i>, or not. It will be Caldecott&rsquo;s
book or nobody&rsquo;s. I am glad you liked the <i>Guitar</i>: I
always did: and I think C. could make lovely pikters
to it: it almost seems as if I must have written it for
him express.</p>

<p>I have already been a visitor at the Club for a fortnight;
but that&rsquo;s over, and I don&rsquo;t much care to renew
the period. I want to be married, not to belong to all
the Clubs in Christendie.... I half think of writing
up the Sand-lot agitation for Morley; it is a curious
business; were I stronger, I should try to sugar in with
some of the leaders: a chield amang &rsquo;em takin&rsquo; notes;
one, who kept a brothel, I reckon, before she started
socialist, particularly interests me. If I am right as to
her early industry, you know she would be sure to adore
me. I have been all my days a dead hand at a harridan,
I never saw the one yet that could resist me. When I
die of consumption, you can put that upon my tomb.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR FERRIER</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for your letter, and
the instalment of <i>Forester</i> which accompanied it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>270</span>
which I read with amusement and pleasure. I fear
Somerset&rsquo;s letter must wait; for my dear boy, I have
been very nearly on a longer voyage than usual; I am
fresh from giving Charon a quid instead of an obolus:
but he, having accepted the payment, scorned me, and I
had to make the best of my way backward through the
mallow-wood, with nothing to show for this displacement
but the fatigue of the journey. As soon as I feel
fit, you shall have the letter, trust me. But just now
even a note such as I am now writing takes it out of me.
I have, truly, been very sick; I fear I am a vain man,
for I thought it a pity I should die. I could not help
thinking that a good many would be disappointed; but
for myself, although I still think life a business full of
agreeable features I was not entirely unwilling to give it
up. It is so difficult to behave well; and in that matter,
I get more dissatisfied with myself, because more exigent,
every day. I shall be pleased to hear again from you
soon. I shall be married early in May and then go to
the mountains, a very withered bridegroom. I think
your MS. Bible, if that were a specimen, would be a credit
to humanity. Between whiles, collect such thoughts
both from yourself and others: I somehow believe every
man should leave a Bible behind him,&mdash;if he is unable
to leave a jest book. I feel fit to leave nothing but my
benediction. It is a strange thing how, do what you
will, nothing seems accomplished. I feel as far from
having paid humanity my board and lodging as I did six
years ago when I was sick at Mentone. But I dare say
the devil would keep telling me so, if I had moved mountains,
and at least I have been very happy on many
different occasions, and that is always something. I can
read nothing, write nothing; but a little while ago and
I could eat nothing either; but now that is changed.

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;You have not answered my last;
and I know you will repent when you hear how near I
have been to another world. For about six weeks I have
been in utter doubt; it was a toss-up for life or death all
that time; but I won the toss, sir, and Hades went off
once more discomfited. This is not the first time, nor
will it be the last, that I have a friendly game with that
gentleman. I know he will end by cleaning me out;
but the rogue is insidious, and the habit of that sort of
gambling seems to be a part of my nature; it was, I
suspect, too much indulged in youth; break your children
of this tendency, my dear Gosse, from the first. It is,
when once formed, a habit more fatal than opium&mdash;I
speak, as St. Paul says, like a fool. I have been very
very sick; on the verge of a galloping consumption, cold
sweats, prostrating attacks of cough, sinking fits in which
I lost the power of speech, fever, and all the ugliest circumstances
of the disease; and I have cause to bless
God, my wife that is to be, and one Dr. Bamford (a name
the Muse repels), that I have come out of all this, and
got my feet once more upon a little hilltop, with a fair
prospect of life and some new desire of living. Yet I did
not wish to die, neither; only I felt unable to go on
farther with that rough horseplay of human life: a man
must be pretty well to take the business in good part.
Yet I felt all the time that I had done nothing to entitle
me to an honourable discharge; that I had taken up
many obligations and begun many friendships which I
had no right to put away from me; and that for me to
die was to play the cur and slinking sybarite, and desert
the colours on the eve of the decisive fight. Of course I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>272</span>
have done no work for I do not know how long; and
here you can triumph. I have been reduced to writing
verses for amusement. A fact. The whirligig of time
brings in its revenges, after all. But I&rsquo;ll have them buried
with me, I think, for I have not the heart to burn them
while I live. Do write. I shall go to the mountains as
soon as the weather clears; on the way thither, I marry
myself; then I set up my family altar among the pine-woods,
3,000 feet, sir, from the disputatious sea.&mdash;I am,

demand for books, for you have seemingly not yet sent
me one. Still, I live on promises: waiting for Penn, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>273</span>
H. James&rsquo;s <i>Hawthorne</i>, for my <i>Burns</i>, etc.; and now, to
make matters worse, pending your Centuries, etc., I do
earnestly desire the best book about mythology (if it be
German, so much the worse; send a bunctionary along
with it, and pray for me). This is why. If I recover, I
feel called on to write a volume of gods and demi-gods
in exile: Pan, Jove, Cybele, Venus, Charon, etc.; and
though I should like to take them very free, I should like
to know a little about &rsquo;em to begin with. For two days,
till last night, I had no night sweats, and my cough is
almost gone, and I digest well; so all looks hopeful.
However, I was near the other side of Jordan. I send
the proof of <i>Thoreau</i> to you, so that you may correct and
fill up the quotation from Goethe. It is a pity I was ill,
as, for matter, I think I prefer that to any of my essays
except <i>Burns</i>; but the style, though quite manly, never
attains any melody or lenity. So much for consumption:
I begin to appreciate what the <i>Emigrant</i> must be. As

changed. God only knows how much courage and suffering

Another week, the doctor said, and I should have been
past salvation. I think I shall always think of it as my
best work. There is one page in Part II., about having

<p>I am now out of danger; in but a short while (<i>i.e.</i> as
soon as the weather is settled), F. and I marry and go
up to the hills to look for a place; &ldquo;I to the hills will lift
mine eyes, from whence doth come mine aid&ldquo;: once the
place found, the furniture will follow. There, sir, in, I
hope, a ranche among the pine-trees and hard by a running

French, Latin, Euclid, and History; and, if possible, not
quarrel. Far from man, sir, in the virgin forest. Thence,
as my strength returns, you may expect works of genius.
I always feel as if I must write a work of genius some time
or other; and when is it more likely to come off, than
just after I have paid a visit to Styx and go thence to
the eternal mountains? Such a revolution in a man&rsquo;s
affairs, as I have somewhere written, would set anybody
singing. When we get installed, Lloyd and I are going
to print my poetical works; so all those who have been

They are, I believe, pretty correct literary exercises, or
will be, with a few filings; but they are not remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>275</span>

respectable versifications of very proper and even original
sentiments: kind of Hayleyistic, I fear&mdash;but no, this is
morbid self-depreciation. The family is all very shaky
in health, but our motto is now <i>Al Monte</i>! in the words

<p>This correspondent is the late Mr. Charles Warren Stoddard,
author of <i>Summer Cruising in the South Seas</i>, etc., with whom

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR STODDARD</span>,&mdash;I am guilty in thy sight and the
sight of God. However, I swore a great oath that you
should see some of my manuscript at last; and though I
have long delayed to keep it, yet it was to be. You re-read
your story and were disgusted; that is the cold fit
following the hot. I don&rsquo;t say you did wrong to be disgusted,
yet I am sure you did wrong to be disgusted
altogether. There was, you may depend upon it, some
reason for your previous vanity, as well as your present
mortification. I shall hear you, years from now, timidly
begin to retrim your feathers for a little self-laudation,
and trot out this misdespised novelette as not the worst
of your performances. I read the album extracts with
sincere interest; but I regret that you spared to give the
paper more development; and I conceive that you might
do a great deal worse than expand each of its paragraphs
into an essay or sketch, the excuse being in each case
your personal intercourse; the bulk, when that would
not be sufficient, to be made up from their own works
and stories. Three at least&mdash;Menken, Yelverton, and
Keeler&mdash;could not fail of a vivid human interest. Let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>276</span>
press upon you this plan; should any document be
wanted from Europe, let me offer my services to procure
it. I am persuaded that there is stuff in the idea.</p>

<p>Are you coming over again to see me some day soon?
I keep returning, and now hand over fist, from the realms
of Hades; I saw that gentleman between the eyes, and
fear him less after each visit. Only Charon, and his
rough boatmanship, I somewhat fear.</p>

<p>I have a desire to write some verses for your album;
so, if you will give me the entry among your gods, goddesses,
and godlets, there will be nothing wanting but
the Muse. I think of the verses like Mark Twain; sometimes
I wish fulsomely to belaud you; sometimes to
insult your city and fellow-citizens; sometimes to sit
down quietly, with the slender reed, and troll a few staves
of Panic ecstasy&mdash;but fy! fy! as my ancestors observed,
the last is too easy for a man of my feet and inches.</p>

<p>At least, Stoddard, you now see that, although so
costive, when I once begin I am a copious letter-writer.
I thank you, and <i>au revoir</i>.</p>

<p class="sc rt">Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<p class="to">To Sidney Colvin</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>San Francisco, May 1880.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;It is a long while since I have heard
from you; nearly a month, I believe; and I begin to
grow very uneasy. At first I was tempted to suppose
that I had been myself to blame in some way; but now
I have grown to fear lest some sickness or trouble among
those whom you love may not be the impediment. I
believe I shall soon hear; so I wait as best I can. I
am, beyond a doubt, greatly stronger, and yet still useless
for any work, and, I may say, for any pleasure. My
affairs and the bad weather still keep me here unmarried;
but not, I earnestly hope, for long. Whenever I get into
the mountain, I trust I shall rapidly pick up. Until I get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>277</span>
away from these sea fogs and my imprisonment in the
house, I do not hope to do much more than keep from
active harm. My doctor took a desponding fit about me,
and scared Fanny into blue fits; but I have talked her
over again. It is the change I want, and the blessed
sun, and a gentle air in which I can sit out and see the
trees and running water: these mere defensive hygienics
cannot advance one, though they may prevent evil. I do
nothing now, but try to possess my soul in peace, and
continue to possess my body on any terms.</p>

<p><i>Calistoga, Napa County, California.</i>&mdash;All which is a
fortnight old and not much to the point nowadays. Here
we are, Fanny and I, and a certain hound, in a lovely
valley under Mount Saint Helena, looking around, or
rather wondering when we shall begin to look around,
for a house of our own. I have received the first sheets
of the <i>Amateur Emigrant</i>; not yet the second bunch, as
announced. It is a pretty heavy, emphatic piece of
pedantry; but I don&rsquo;t care; the public, I verily believe,
will like it. I have excised all you proposed and more
on my own movement. But I have not yet been able to
rewrite the two special pieces which, as you said, so badly
wanted it; it is hard work to rewrite passages in proof;
and the easiest work is still hard to me. But I am certainly
recovering fast; a married and convalescent being.</p>

<p>Received James&rsquo;s <i>Hawthorne</i>, on which I meditate a
blast, Miss Bird, Dixon&rsquo;s <i>Penn</i>, a <i>wrong</i> Cornhill (like my
luck) and <i>Coquelin</i>: for all which, and especially the
last, I tender my best thanks. I have opened only James;
it is very clever, very well written, and out of sight the
most inside-out thing in the world; I have dug up the
hatchet; a scalp shall flutter at my belt ere long. I
think my new book should be good; it will contain our
adventures for the summer, so far as these are worth
narrating; and I have already a few pages of diary
which should make up bright. I am going to repeat
my old experiment, after buckling-to a while to write more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>278</span>
correctly, lie down and have a wallow. Whether I shall
get any of my novels done this summer I do not know; I
wish to finish the <i>Vendetta</i> first, for it really could not
come after <i>Prince Otto</i>. Lewis Campbell has made some
noble work in that Agamemnon; it surprised me. We
hope to get a house at Silverado, a deserted mining-camp
eight miles up the mountain, now solely inhabited by a
mighty hunter answering to the name of Rufe Hansome,
who slew last year a hundred and fifty deer. This is
the motto I propose for the new volume: &ldquo;<i>Vixerunt
nonnulli in agris, delectati re sua familiari. His idem
propositum fuit quod regibus, ut ne qua re egerent, ne cui
parerent, libertate uterentur; cujus proprium est sic vivere
ut velis.</i>&rdquo; I always have a terror lest the wish should
have been father to the translation, when I come to
quote; but that seems too plain sailing. I should put
<i>regibus</i> in capitals for the pleasantry&rsquo;s sake. We are in
the Coast range, that being so much cheaper to reach;
the family, I hope, will soon follow. Love to all.&mdash;Ever
yours,</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_27" href="#FnAnchor_27"><span class="fn">27</span></a> In reference to the father&rsquo;s estrangement at this time, Sir James
Dewar, an old friend of the elder Stevenson, tells a story which
would have touched R. L. S. infinitely had he heard it. Sir James
(then Professor) Dewar and Mr. Thomas Stevenson were engaged
together on some official scientific work near Duns in Berwickshire.
&ldquo;Spending the evening together,&rdquo; writes Sir James, &ldquo;at an hotel in
Berwick-on-Tweed, the two, after a long day&rsquo;s work, fell into close
fireside talk over their toddy, and Mr. Stevenson opened his heart
upon what was to him a very sore grievance. He spoke with anger
and dismay of his son&rsquo;s journey and intentions, his desertion of the
old firm, and taking to the devious and barren paths of literature.
The Professor took up the cudgels in the son&rsquo;s defence, and at last,
by way of ending the argument, half jocularly offered to wager that
in ten years from that moment R. L. S. would be earning a bigger
income than the old firm had ever commanded. To his surprise,
the father became furious, and repulsed all attempts at reconciliation.
But six and a half years later, Mr. Stevenson, broken in
health, came to London to seek medical advice, and although so
feeble that he had to be lifted out and into his cab, called at the
Royal Institute to see the Professor. He said: &ldquo;I am here to
consult a doctor, but I couldna be in London without coming to
shake your hand and confess that you were richt after a&rsquo; about
Louis, and I was wrang.&rdquo; The frail old frame shook with emotion,
and he muttered, &ldquo;I ken this is my last visit to the south.&rdquo; A few
weeks later he was dead.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<h3>ALPINE WINTERS
AND HIGHLAND SUMMERS</h3>

<h6><span class="sc">August 1880-October 1882</span></h6>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">After</span> spending the months of June and July 1880 in
the rough Californian mountain quarters described in the
<i>Silverado Squatters</i>, Stevenson took passage with his wife
and young stepson from New York on the 7th of August,
and arrived on the 17th at Liverpool, where his parents
and I were waiting to meet him. Of her new family, the
Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson brought thus strangely and
from far into their midst made an immediate conquest.
To her husband&rsquo;s especial happiness, there sprang up
between her and his father the closest possible affection
and confidence. Parents and friends&mdash;if it is permissible
to one of the latter to say as much&mdash;rejoiced to recognise
in Stevenson&rsquo;s wife a character as strong, interesting, and
romantic almost as his own; an inseparable sharer of all
his thoughts and staunch companion of all his adventures;
the most open-hearted of friends to all who loved him;
the most shrewd and stimulating critic of his work; and
in sickness, despite her own precarious health, the most
devoted and most efficient of nurses.</p>

<p>From Liverpool the Stevenson party went on to make
a stay in Scotland, first at Edinburgh, and afterwards for
a few weeks at Strathpeffer, resting at Blair Athol on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>280</span>
way. It was now, in his thirtieth year, among the woods
of Tummelside and under the shoulder of Ben Wyvis,
that Stevenson acknowledged for the first time the full
power and beauty of the Highland scenery, which in
youth, with his longings fixed ever upon the South, he
had been accustomed to think too bleak and desolate. In
the history of the country and its clans, on the other
hand, and especially of their political and social transformation
during the eighteenth century, he had been
always keenly interested. In conversations with Principal
Tulloch at Strathpeffer this interest was now revived,
and he resolved to attempt a book on the subject, his father
undertaking to keep him supplied with books and authorities;
for it had quickly become apparent that he could
not winter in Scotland. The state of his health continued
to be very threatening. He suffered from acute
chronic catarrh, accompanied by disquieting lung symptoms
and great weakness; and was told accordingly
that he must go for the winter, and probably for several
succeeding winters, to the mountain valley of Davos in
Switzerland, which within the last few years had been
coming into repute as a place of recovery, or at least of
arrested mischief, for lung patients. Thither he and his
wife and stepson travelled accordingly at the end of
October. Nor must another member of the party be forgotten,
a black thoroughbred Skye terrier, the gift of
Sir Walter Simpson. This creature was named, after his
giver, Walter&mdash;a name subsequently corrupted into Wattie,
Woggie, Wogg, Woggin, Bogie, Bogue, and a number of
other affectionate diminutives which will be found occurring
often enough in the following pages. He was a
remarkably pretty, engaging, excitable, ill-behaved little
specimen of his race, the occasion of infinite anxiety and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>281</span>
laughing care to his devoted master and mistress until
his death six years later.</p>

<p>The Davos of 1880, approached by an eight-hours&rsquo;
laborious drive up the valley of the Prättigau, was a very
different place from the extended and embellished Davos
of to-day, with its railway, its modern shops, its electric
lighting, and its crowd of winter visitors bent on outdoor
and indoor entertainment. The Stevensons&rsquo; quarters for
the first winter were at the Hotel Belvedere, then a mere
nucleus of the huge establishment it has since become.
Besides the usual society of an invalid hotel, with its
mingled tragedies and comedies, they had there the great
advantage of the presence, in a neighbouring house, of an
accomplished man of letters and one of the most charming
of companions, John Addington Symonds, with his
family. Mr. Symonds, whose health had been desperate
before he tried the place, was a living testimony to its
virtues, and was at this time engaged in building the chalet
which became his home until he died fourteen years later.
During Stevenson&rsquo;s first season at Davos, though his
mind was full of literary enterprises, he was too ill to do
much actual work. For the Highland history he read
much, but composed little or nothing, and eventually this
history went to swell the long list of his unwritten books.
He saw through the press his first volume of collected
essays, <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i>, which came out early in
1881; wrote the essays <i>Samuel Pepys</i> and <i>The Morality
of the Profession of Letters</i>, for the Cornhill and the Fortnightly
Review respectively, and sent to the Pall Mall
Gazette the papers on the life and climate of Davos,
posthumously reprinted in <i>Essays of Travel</i>. Beyond this,
he only amused himself with verses, some of them afterwards
published in <i>Underwoods</i>. Leaving the Alps at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>282</span>
end of April 1881, he returned, after a short stay in France
(at Fontainebleau, Paris, and St. Germain), to his family
in Edinburgh. Thence the whole party again went to the
Highlands, this time to Pitlochry and Braemar.</p>

<p>During the summer Stevenson heard of the intended
retirement of Professor Æneas Mackay from the chair
of History and Constitutional Law at Edinburgh University.
He determined, with the encouragement of the
outgoing professor and of several of his literary friends,
to become a candidate for the post, which had to be filled
by the Faculty of Advocates from among their own
number. The duties were limited to the delivery of a
short course of lectures in the summer term, and Stevenson
thought that he might be equal to them, and might
prove, though certainly a new, yet perhaps a stimulating,
type of professor. But knowing the nature of his public
reputation, especially in Edinburgh, where the recollection
of his daft student days was as yet stronger than the
impression made by his recent performances in literature,
he was well aware that his candidature must seem paradoxical,
and stood little chance of success. The election
took place in the late autumn of the same year, and he
was defeated, receiving only three votes.</p>

<p>At Pitlochry Stevenson was for a while able to enjoy
his life and to work well, writing two of the strongest of
his short stories of Scottish life and superstition, <i>Thrawn
Janet</i> and <i>The Merry Men</i>, originally designed to form
part of a volume to be written by himself and his wife
in collaboration. At Braemar he made a beginning of
the nursery verses which afterwards grew into the volume
called <i>The Child&rsquo;s Garden</i>, and conceived and half executed
the fortunate project of <i>Treasure Island</i>, the book which
was destined first to make him famous. But one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>283</span>
most inclement of Scottish summers had before long
undone all the good gained in the previous winter at
Davos, and in the autumn of the year 1881 he repaired
thither again.</p>

<p>This time his quarters were in a small chalet belonging
to the proprietors of the Buol Hotel, the Chalet am Stein,
or Chalet Buol, in the near neighbourhood of the Symonds&rsquo;s
house. The beginning of his second stay was darkened
by the serious illness of his wife; nevertheless the winter
was one of much greater literary activity than the last.
A Life of Hazlitt was projected, and studies were made
for it, but for various reasons the project was never carried
out. <i>Treasure Island</i> was finished; the greater part
of the <i>Silverado Squatters</i> written; so were the essays
<i>Talk and Talkers</i>, <i>A Gossip on Romance</i>, and several other
of his best papers for magazines. By way of whim and
pastime he occupied himself, to his own and his stepson&rsquo;s
delight, with a little set of woodcuts and verses printed
by the latter at his toy press&mdash;&ldquo;The Davos Press,&rdquo; as
they called it&mdash;as well as with mimic campaigns carried
on between the man and boy with armies of lead soldiers
in the spacious loft which filled the upper floor of the
chalet. For the first and almost the only time in his life
there awoke in him during these winters in Davos the
spirit of lampoon; and he poured forth sets of verses,
not without touches of a Swiftean fire, against commercial
frauds in general, and those of certain local tradesmen in
particular, as well as others in memory of a defunct
publican of Edinburgh who had been one of his butts in
youth (<i>Casparidea</i> and <i>Brashiana</i>, both unpublished: see
pp. 14, 15, 38 in vol. 24 of the present edition). Finally,
much revived in health by the beneficent air of the Alpine
valley, he left it again in mid-spring of 1882, to return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>284</span>
once more to Scotland, and to be once more thrown back
to, or below, the point whence he had started. After a
short excursion from Edinburgh into the Appin country,
where he made inquiries on the spot into the traditions
concerning the murder of Campbell of Glenure, his three
resting-places in Scotland during this summer were Stobo
Manse near Peebles, Lochearnhead, and Kingussie. At
Stobo the dampness of the season and the place quickly
threw him again into a very low state of health, from
which three subsequent weeks of brilliant sunshine in
Speyside did but little to restore him. In spite of this
renewed breakdown, when autumn came he would not face
the idea of returning for a third season to Davos. He
had himself felt deeply the austerity and monotony of
the white Alpine world in winter; and though he had unquestionably
gained in health there, his wife on her part
had suffered much. So he made up his mind once again
to try the Mediterranean coast of France, and Davos
knew him no more.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I feel better, but variable. I see
from the doctor&rsquo;s report that I have more actual disease
than I supposed; but there seems little doubt of my
recovery. I like the place and shall like it much better
when you come at Christmas. That is written on my
heart: S. C. comes at Christmas: so if you play me false,
I shall have a lie upon my conscience. I like Symonds
very well, though he is much, I think, of an invalid in
mind and character. But his mind is interesting, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>292</span>
many beautiful corners, and his consumptive smile very
winning to see. We have had some good talks; one went
over Zola, Balzac, Flaubert, Whitman, Christ, Handel,
Milton, Sir Thomas Browne; do you see the <i>liaison</i>?&mdash;in
another, I, the Bohnist, the un-Grecian, was the means
of his conversion in the matter of the Ajax. It is truly
not for nothing that I have read my Buckley.<a name="FnAnchor_32" href="#Footnote_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a></p>

<p>To-day the south wind blows; and I am seedy in
consequence.</p>

to get you a room. You will toboggan and skate your
head off, and I will talk it off, and briefly if you don&rsquo;t
come pretty soon, I will cut you off with a shilling.</p>

write in preference to this; but a duty to letters and

going to collect odes; I could not wish a better man to
do so; but I tremble lest you should commit two sins of
omission. You will not, I am sure, be so far left to yourself
as to give us no more of Dryden than the hackneyed
St. Cecilia; I know you will give us some others of those
surprising masterpieces where there is more sustained
eloquence and harmony of English numbers than in all
that has been written since; there is a machine about a
poetical young lady,<a name="FnAnchor_33" href="#Footnote_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> and another about either Charles or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>293</span>
James, I know not which; and they are both indescribably
fine. (Is Marvell&rsquo;s Horatian Ode good enough? I
half think so.) But my great point is a fear that you are
one of those who are unjust to our old Tennyson&rsquo;s Duke of
Wellington. I have just been talking it over with Symonds;
and we agreed that whether for its metrical effects, for its
brief, plain, stirring words of portraiture, as&mdash;he &ldquo;that
never lost an English gun,&rdquo; or&mdash;the soldier salute; or for
the heroic apostrophe to Nelson; that ode has never
been surpassed in any tongue or time. Grant me the
Duke, O Weg! I suppose you must not put in yours
about the warship; you will have to admit worse ones,
however.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR WEG</span>,&mdash;We both insist on the Duke of Wellington.
Really it cannot be left out. Symonds said you
would cover yourself with shame, and I add, your friends
with confusion, if you leave it out. Really, you know it
is the only thing you have, since Dryden, where that
irregular odic, odal, odous (?) verse is used with mastery
and sense. And it&rsquo;s one of our few English blood-boilers.</p>

<p>(3) Shelley (1) <i>The World&rsquo;s Great Age</i> from Hellas;
we are both dead on. After that you have, of course,

be enough; no more than two any way.</p>

<p>(4) Herrick. <i>Meddowes</i> and <i>Come, my Corinna</i>. After

a dear; we can&rsquo;t stand the &ldquo;sigh&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;peruke.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>294</span></p>

<p>(6) Milton. <i>Time</i> and the <i>Solemn Music</i>. We both
agree we would rather go without L&rsquo;Allegro and Il Penseroso
than these; for the reason that these are not so
well known to the brutish herd.</p>

<p>(7) Is the <i>Royal George</i> an ode, or only an elegy?
It&rsquo;s so good.</p>

<p>(8) We leave Campbell to you.</p>

<p>(9) If you take anything from Clough, but we don&rsquo;t
either of us fancy you will, let it be <i>Come back</i>.</p>

<p>(10) Quite right about Dryden. I had a hankering
after <i>Threnodia Augustalis</i>; but I find it long and with
very prosaic holes: though, O! what fine stuff between
whiles.</p>

<p>(11) Right with Collins.</p>

<p>(12) Right about Pope&rsquo;s Ode. But what can you
give? <i>The Dying Christian?</i> or one of his inimitable
courtesies? These last are fairly odes, by the Horatian
model, just as my dear <i>Meddowes</i> is an ode in the name
and for the sake of Bandusia.</p>

<p>(13) Whatever you do, you&rsquo;ll give us the Greek
Vase.</p>

<p>(14) Do you like Jonson&rsquo;s &ldquo;loathed stage&ldquo;? Verses
2, 3, and 4 are so bad, also the last line. But there is a
fine movement and feeling in the rest.</p>

<p>The prospect here alluded to of a cheap edition of the little

</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Hotel Belvedere, Davos</i>, [<i>December 1880</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR CHARLES WARREN STODDARD</span>,&mdash;Many thanks to
you for the letter and the photograph. Will you think
it mean if I ask you to wait till there appears a promised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>295</span>
cheap edition? Possibly the canny Scot does feel pleasure
in the superior cheapness; but the true reason is this,
that I think to put a few words, by way of notes, to each
book in its new form, because that will be the Standard
Edition, without which no g.&rsquo;s l.<a name="FnAnchor_34" href="#Footnote_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> will be complete. The
edition, briefly, <i>sine qua non</i>. Before that, I shall hope
to send you my essays, which are in the printer&rsquo;s hands.
I look to get yours soon. I am sorry to hear that the
Custom House has proved fallible, like all other human
houses and customs. Life consists of that sort of business,
and I fear that there is a class of man, of which you
offer no inapt type, doomed to a kind of mild, general disappointment
through life. I do not believe that a man is
the more unhappy for that. Disappointment, except
with one&rsquo;s self, is not a very capital affair; and the sham
beatitude, &ldquo;Blessed is he that expecteth little,&rdquo; one of
the truest, and in a sense, the most Christlike things in
literature.</p>

<p>Alongside of you, I have been all my days a red cannon
ball of dissipated effort; here I am by the heels in this
Alpine valley, with just so much of a prospect of future
restoration as shall make my present caged estate easily
tolerable to me&mdash;shall or should, I would not swear to
the word before the trial&rsquo;s done. I miss all my objects
in the meantime; and, thank God, I have enough
of my old, and maybe somewhat base philosophy, to
keep me on a good understanding with myself and
Providence.</p>

<p>The mere extent of a man&rsquo;s travels has in it something
consolatory. That he should have left friends and
enemies in many different and distant quarters gives a
sort of earthly dignity to his existence. And I think the
better of myself for the belief that I have left some in
California interested in me and my successes. Let me
assure you, you who have made friends already among
such various and distant races, that there is a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296"></a>296</span>
phthisical Scot who will always be pleased to hear good
news of you, and would be better pleased by nothing than
to learn that you had thrown off your present incubus,
largely consisting of letters I believe, and had sailed into
some square work by way of change.</p>

<p>And by way of change in itself, let me copy on the
other pages some broad Scotch I wrote for you when I
was ill last spring in Oakland. It is no muckle worth:

<p>The verses here mentioned to Dr. John Brown (the admired
author of <i>Rab and his Friends</i>) were meant as a reply to a letter

before. They are printed in <i>Underwoods</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Hotel Belvedere, Davos, December 21, 1880.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR PEOPLE</span>,&mdash;I do not understand these reproaches.
The letters come between seven and nine in
the evening; and every one about the books was answered
that same night, and the answer left Davos by seven
o&rsquo;clock next morning. Perhaps the snow delayed them;
if so, &rsquo;tis a good hint to you not to be uneasy at apparent
silences. There is no hurry about my father&rsquo;s notes; I
shall not be writing anything till I get home again, I
believe. Only I want to be able to keep reading <i>ad hoc</i>
all winter, as it seems about all I shall be fit for. About
John Brown, I have been breaking my heart to finish a
Scotch poem to him. Some of it is not really bad, but
the rest will not come, and I mean to get it right before
I do anything else.</p>

<p>The bazaar is over, £160 gained, and everybody&rsquo;s
health lost: altogether, I never had a more uncomfortable
time; apply to Fanny for further details of the
discomfort.</p>

<p>We have our Wogg in somewhat better trim now, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>297</span>
vastly better spirits. The weather has been bad&mdash;for
Davos, but indeed it is a wonderful climate. It never
feels cold; yesterday, with a little, chill, small, northerly
draught, for the first time, it was pinching. Usually, it
may freeze, or snow, or do what it pleases, you feel
it not, or hardly any.</p>

<p>Thanks for your notes; that fishery question will come
in, as you notice, in the Highland Book, as well as under
the Union; it is very important. I hear no word of
Hugh Miller&rsquo;s <i>Evictions</i>; I count on that. What you
say about the old and new Statistical is odd. It seems to
me very much as if I were gingerly embarking on a <i>History
of Modern Scotland</i>. Probably Tulloch will never carry it
out. And, you see, once I have studied and written these
two vols., <i>The Transformation of the Scottish Highlands</i>
and <i>Scotland and the Union</i>, I shall have a good ground to
go upon. The effect on my mind of what I have read has
been to awaken a livelier sympathy for the Irish; although
they never had the remarkable virtues, I fear they have
suffered many of the injustices, of the Scottish Highlanders.
Ruedi has seen me this morning; he says the
disease is at a standstill, and I am to profit by it to take
more exercise. Altogether, he seemed quite hopeful and
pleased.&mdash;I am your ever affectionate son,</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Hotel Belvedere, Davos</i>, [<i>Christmas 1880</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;Thanks for yours; I waited, as I
said I would. I now expect no answer from you, regarding
you as a mere dumb cock-shy, or a target, at which
we fire our arrows diligently all day long, with no anticipation
it will bring them back to us. We are both sadly
mortified you are not coming, but health comes first;
alas, that man should be so crazy. What fun we could
have, if we were all well, what work we could do, what a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>298</span>
happy place we could make it for each other! If I were
able to do what I want; but then I am not, and may
leave that vein.</p>

<p>No. I do not think I shall require to know the Gaelic;
few things are written in that language, or ever were;
if you come to that, the number of those who could write,
or even read it, through almost all my period, must, by
all accounts, have been incredibly small. Of course,
until the book is done, I must live as much as possible in
the Highlands, and that suits my book as to health. It is
a most interesting and sad story, and from the &rsquo;45 it is
all to be written for the first time. This, of course, will
cause me a far greater difficulty about authorities; but
I have already learned much, and where to look for more.
One pleasant feature is the vast number of delightful
writers I shall have to deal with: Burt, Johnson, Boswell,
Mrs. Grant of Laggan, Scott. There will be interesting
sections on the Ossianic controversy and the growth of
the taste for Highland scenery. I have to touch upon
Rob Roy, Flora Macdonald, the strange story of Lady
Grange, the beautiful story of the tenants on the Forfeited
Estates, and the odd, inhuman problem of the great
evictions. The religious conditions are wild, unknown,
very surprising. And three out of my five parts remain
hitherto entirely unwritten. Smack!&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<i>Christmas Sermon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;I was very tired yesterday and
could not write; tobogganed so furiously all morning;
we had a delightful day, crowned by an incredible dinner&mdash;more
courses than I have fingers on my hands. Your
letter arrived duly at night, and I thank you for it as I
should. You need not suppose I am at all insensible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>299</span>
my father&rsquo;s extraordinary kindness about this book; he
is a brick; I vote for him freely.</p>

<p>... The assurance you speak of is what we all ought
to have, and might have, and should not consent to live
without. That people do not have it more than they do is,
I believe, because persons speak so much in large-drawn,
theological similitudes, and won&rsquo;t say out what they mean
about life, and man, and God, in fair and square human
language. I wonder if you or my father ever thought of
the obscurities that lie upon human duty from the negative
form in which the Ten Commandments are stated, or
of how Christ was so continually substituting affirmations.
&ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo; is but an example; &ldquo;Thou
shalt&rdquo; is the law of God. It was this that seems meant
in the phrase that &ldquo;not one jot nor tittle of the law should
pass.&rdquo; But what led me to the remark is this: A kind of
black, angry look goes with that statement of the law
of negatives. &ldquo;To love one&rsquo;s neighbour as oneself&rdquo; is
certainly much harder, but states life so much more
actively, gladly, and kindly, that you can begin to see
some pleasure in it; and till you can see pleasure in these
hard choices and bitter necessities, where is there any
Good News to men? It is much more important to do
right than not to do wrong; further, the one is possible,
the other has always been and will ever be impossible;
and the faithful <i>design to do right</i> is accepted by God;
that seems to me to be the Gospel, and that was how
Christ delivered us from the Law. After people are told
that, surely they might hear more encouraging sermons.
To blow the trumpet for good would seem the Parson&rsquo;s
business; and since it is not in our own strength, but
by faith and perseverance (no account made of slips),
that we are to run the race, I do not see where they get
the material for their gloomy discourses. Faith is not to
believe the Bible, but to believe in God; if you believe
in God (or, for it&rsquo;s the same thing, have that assurance
you speak about), where is there any more room for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>300</span>
terror? There are only three possible attitudes&mdash;Optimism,
which has gone to smash; Pessimism, which is on
the rising hand, and very popular with many clergymen
who seem to think they are Christians. And this Faith,
which is the Gospel. Once you hold the last, it is your
business (1) to find out what is right in any given case,
and (2) to try to do it; if you fail in the last, that is by
commission, Christ tells you to hope; if you fail in the
first, that is by omission, his picture of the last day gives
you but a black lookout. The whole necessary morality
is kindness; and it should spring, of itself, from the one
fundamental doctrine, Faith. If you are sure that God,
in the long run, means kindness by you, you should
be happy; and if happy, surely you should be
kind.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon for this long discourse; it is not all
right, of course, but I am sure there is something in it.
One thing I have not got clearly; that about the omission
and the commission; but there is truth somewhere
about it, and I have no time to clear it just now. Do

<p>I did go out to Davos after all in January, and found Stevenson
apparently little improved in health, and depressed by a sad turn
of destiny which had brought out his old friend Mrs. Sitwell to
the same place, at the same time, to watch beside the deathbed of
her son&mdash;the youth commemorated in the verses headed <i>F. A. S.,
In Memoriam</i>, afterwards published in <i>Underwoods</i>. The following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301"></a>301</span>
letter refers to a copy of Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Reminiscences</i> which I had
sent him some time after I came back to England.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Hotel Belvedere, Davos</i>, [<i>Spring 1881</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;My health is not just what it should
be; I have lost weight, pulse, respiration, etc., and gained
nothing in the way of my old bellows. But these last few
days, with tonic, cod-liver oil, better wine (there is some
better now), and perpetual beef-tea, I think I have progressed.
To say truth, I have been here a little over long.
I was reckoning up, and since I have known you, already
quite a while, I have not, I believe, remained so long in any
one place as here in Davos. That tells on my old gipsy
nature; like a violin hung up, I begin to lose what music
there was in me; and with the music, I do not know what
besides, or do not know what to call it, but something
radically part of life, a rhythm, perhaps, in one&rsquo;s old
and so brutally over-ridden nerves, or perhaps a kind of
variety of blood that the heart has come to look for.</p>

<p>I purposely knocked myself off first. As to F. A. S., I
believe I am no sound authority; I alternate between a
stiff disregard and a kind of horror. In neither mood
can a man judge at all. I know the thing to be terribly
perilous, I fear it to be now altogether hopeless. Luck
has failed; the weather has not been favourable; and in
her true heart, the mother hopes no more. But&mdash;well, I
feel a great deal, that I either cannot or will not say, as
you well know. It has helped to make me more conscious
of the wolverine on my own shoulders, and that also
makes me a poor judge and poor adviser. Perhaps, if we
were all marched out in a row, and a piece of platoon
firing to the drums performed, it would be well for us;
although, I suppose&mdash;and yet I wonder!&mdash;so ill for the
poor mother and for the dear wife. But you can see this
makes me morbid. <i>Sufficit; explicit</i>.</p>

<p>You are right about the Carlyle book; F. and I are in
a world not ours; but pardon me, as far as sending on
goes, we take another view: the first volume, <i>à la bonne</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>302</span>
<i>heure!</i> but not&mdash;never&mdash;the second. Two hours of
hysterics can be no good matter for a sick nurse, and the
strange, hard, old being in so lamentable and yet human
a desolation&mdash;crying out like a burnt child, and yet always
wisely and beautifully&mdash;how can that end, as a piece of
reading, even to the strong&mdash;but on the brink of the most
cruel kind of weeping? I observe the old man&rsquo;s style is
stronger on me than ever it was, and by rights, too, since
I have just laid down his most attaching book. God rest
the baith o&rsquo; them I But even if they do not meet again,
how we should all be strengthened to be kind, and not
only in act, in speech also, that so much more important
part. See what this apostle of silence most regrets, not
speaking out his heart.</p>

<p>I was struck as you were by the admirable, sudden,
clear sunshine upon Southey&mdash;even on his works.
Symonds, to whom I repeated it, remarked at once, a
man who was thus respected by both Carlyle and Landor
must have had more in him than we can trace. So I feel
with true humility.</p>

<p>It was to save my brain that Symonds proposed reviewing.
He and, it appears, Leslie Stephen fear a little
some eclipse: I am not quite without sharing the fear.
I know my own languor as no one else does; it is a dead
down-draught, a heavy fardel. Yet if I could shake off
the wolverine aforesaid, and his fangs are lighter, though
perhaps I feel them more, I believe I could be myself
again a while. I have not written any letter for a great
time; none saying what I feel, since you were here, I
fancy. Be duly obliged for it, and take my most earnest
thanks not only for the books but for your letter.&mdash;Your
affectionate,</p>

questions of work and the states of other people.</p>

came out here, pitched on the <i>Star and Garter</i> (they call

<p>At Pitlochry, Stevenson was for some weeks in good health and
working order. The inquiries about the later life of Jean Cavalier,
the Protestant leader in the Cévennes, refer to a literary scheme,
whether of romance or history I forget, which had been in his mind
ever since the <i>Travels with a Donkey</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Kinnaird Cottage, Pitlochry, June 6, 1881.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR WEG</span>,&mdash;Here I am in my native land, being
gently blown and hailed upon, and sitting nearer and
nearer to the fire. A cottage near a moor is soon to
receive our human forms; it is also near a burn to which
Professor Blackie (no less!) has written some verses in
his hot old age, and near a farm from whence we shall
draw cream and fatness. Should I be moved to join
Blackie, I shall go upon my knees and pray hard against
temptation; although, since the new Version, I do not
know the proper form of words. The swollen, childish,
and pedantic vanity that moved the said revisers to put
&ldquo;bring&rdquo; for &ldquo;lead,&rdquo; is a sort of literary fault that calls
for an eternal hell; it may be quite a small place, a star
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"></a>307</span>
of the least magnitude, and shabbily furnished; there
shall &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;, the revisers of the Bible and other absolutely
loathsome literary lepers, dwell among broken
pens, bad, <i>groundy</i> ink and ruled blotting-paper made in
France&mdash;all eagerly burning to write, and all inflicted
with incurable aphasia. I should not have thought upon
that torture had I not suffered it in moderation myself,
but it is too horrid even for a hell; let&rsquo;s let &rsquo;em off with
an eternal toothache.</p>

<p>All this talk is partly to persuade you that I write to
you out of good feeling only, which is not the case. I am
a beggar; ask Dobson, Saintsbury, yourself, and any
other of these cheeses who know something of the
eighteenth century, what became of Jean Cavalier between
his coming to England and his death in 1740. Is anything
interesting known about him? Whom did he
marry? The happy French, smilingly following one
another in a long procession headed by the loud and empty
Napoleon Peyrat, say, Olympe Dunoyer, Voltaire&rsquo;s old
flame. Vacquerie even thinks that they were rivals, and
is very French and very literary and very silly in his
comments. Now I may almost say it consists with my
knowledge that all this has not a shadow to rest upon.
It is very odd and very annoying; I have splendid
materials for Cavalier till he comes to my own country;
and there, though he continues to advance in the service,
he becomes entirely invisible to me. Any information
about him will be greatly welcome: I may mention that
I know as much as I desire about the other prophets,
Marion, Fage, Cavalier (de Sonne), my Cavalier&rsquo;s cousin,
the unhappy Lions, and the idiotic Mr. Lacy; so if any
erudite starts upon that track, you may choke him off.
If you can find aught for me, or if you will but try, count
on my undying gratitude. Lang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Library&rdquo; is very
pleasant reading. My book <i>will</i> reach you soon, for I write
about it to-day.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

health improves. We have a lovely spot here: a little
green glen with a burn, a wonderful burn, gold and green
and snow-white, singing loud and low in different steps of
its career, now pouring over miniature crags, now fretting
itself to death in a maze of rocky stairs and pots; never
was so sweet a little river. Behind, great purple moorlands
reaching to Ben Vrackie. Hunger lives here, alone
with larks and sheep. Sweet spot, sweet spot.</p>

works are unfortunately so light and trifling they may
interfere. But if you think, as I think, I am fit to fight
it, send me the best kind of testimonial stating all you
can in favour of me and, with your best art, turning the
difficulty of my never having done anything in history,
strictly speaking. Second, is there anybody else, think
you, from whom I could wring one&mdash;I mean, you could
wring one for me. Any party in London or Cambridge
who thinks well enough of my little books to back me up
with a few heartfelt words? Jenkin approves highly;
but says, pile in <i>English</i> testimonials. Now I only know
Stephen, Symonds, Lang, Gosse and you, and Meredith,
to be sure. The chair is in the gift of the Faculty of
Advocates, where I believe I am more wondered at than
loved. I do not know the foundation; one or two hundred,
I suppose. But it would be a good thing for me,
out and out good. Help me to live, help me to <i>work</i>, for
I am the better of pressure, and help me to say what I

<p class="rt"><i>Kinnaird Cottage, Pitlochry</i> [<i>July 1881</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR WEG</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for the testimonial;
many thanks for your blind, wondering letter; many
wishes, lastly, for your swift recovery. Insomnia is the
opposite pole from my complaint; which brings with it
a nervous lethargy, an unkind, unwholesome, and ungentle
somnolence, fruitful in heavy heads and heavy eyes
at morning. You cannot sleep; well, I can best explain
my state thus: I cannot wake. Sleep, like the lees of a
posset, lingers all day, lead-heavy, in my knees and ankles.
Weight on the shoulders, torpor on the brain. And there
is more than too much of that from an ungrateful hound
who is now enjoying his first decently competent and
peaceful weeks for close upon two years; happy in a big
brown moor behind him, and an incomparable burn by
his side; happy, above all, in some work&mdash;for at last I
am at work with that appetite and confidence that alone
makes work supportable.</p>

<p>I told you I had something else to say. I am very
tedious&mdash;it is another request. In August and a good
part of September we shall be in Braemar, in a house with
some accommodation. Now Braemar is a place patronised
by the royalty of the Sister Kingdoms&mdash;Victoria and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>314</span>
Cairngorms, sir, honouring that countryside by their conjunct
presence. This seems to me the spot for A Bard.
Now can you come to see us for a little while? I can
promise you, you must like my father, because you are
a human being; you ought to like Braemar, because of
your avocation; and you ought to like me, because I
like you; and again, you must like my wife, because she
likes cats; and as for my mother&mdash;well, come and see,
what do you think? that is best. Mrs. Gosse, my wife
tells me, will have other fish to fry; and to be plain, I
should not like to ask her till I had seen the house. But
a lone man I know we shall be equal to. <i>Qu&rsquo;en dis tu?

<p class="rt"><i>Kinnaird Cottage, Pitlochry</i> [<i>July 1881</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MR. HAMMERTON</span>,&mdash;(There goes the second
M.; it is a certainty.) Thank you for your prompt and
kind answer, little as I deserved it, though I hope to
show you I was less undeserving than I seemed. But just
might I delete two words in your testimonial? The two
words &ldquo;and legal&rdquo; were unfortunately winged by
chance against my weakest spot, and would go far
to damn me.</p>

<p>It was not my bliss that I was interested in when I
was married; it was a sort of marriage <i>in extremis</i>; and
if I am where I am, it is thanks to the care of that lady
who married me when I was a mere complication of cough
and bones, much fitter for an emblem of mortality than
a bridegroom.</p>

<p>I had a fair experience of that kind of illness when all
the women (God bless them!) turn round upon the streets
and look after you with a look that is only too kind not
to be cruel. I have had nearly two years of more or less
prostration. I have done no work whatever since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>315</span>
February before last until quite of late. To be precise,
until the beginning of last month, exactly two essays.
All last winter I was at Davos; and indeed I am home here
just now against the doctor&rsquo;s orders, and must soon be
back again to that unkindly haunt &ldquo;upon the mountains
visitant&ldquo;&mdash;there goes no angel there but the angel of
death.<a name="FnAnchor_37" href="#Footnote_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> The deaths of last winter are still sore spots to
me.... So, you see, I am not very likely to go on a
&ldquo;wild expedition,&rdquo; cis-Stygian at least. The truth is, I
am scarce justified in standing for the chair, though I
hope you will not mention this; and yet my health is one
of my reasons, for the class is in summer.</p>

<p>I hope this statement of my case will make my long
neglect appear less unkind. It was certainly not because
I ever forgot you, or your unwonted kindness; and
it was not because I was in any sense rioting in
pleasures.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear the catamaran is on her legs again;
you have my warmest wishes for a good cruise down the
Saône; and yet there comes some envy to that wish,
for when shall I go cruising? Here a sheer hulk, alas!
lies R. L. S. But I will continue to hope for a better
time, canoes that will sail better to the wind, and a river
grander than the Saône.</p>

<p>I heard, by the way, in a letter of counsel from a
well-wisher, one reason of my town&rsquo;s absurdity about
the chair of Art:<a name="FnAnchor_38" href="#Footnote_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> I fear it is characteristic of
her manners. It was because you did not call upon the
electors!</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;I do believe I am better, mind and
body; I am tired just now, for I have just been up the
burn with Wogg, daily growing better and boo&rsquo;f&rsquo;ler; so
do not judge my state by my style in this. I am working
steady, four Cornhill pages scrolled every day, besides
the correspondence about this chair, which is heavy in
itself. My first story, <i>Thrawn Janet</i>, all in Scotch, is
accepted by Stephen; my second, <i>The Body Snatchers</i>, is
laid aside in a justifiable disgust, the tale being horrid;
my third, <i>The Merry Men</i>, I am more than half through,
and think real well of. It is a fantastic sonata about the
sea and wrecks; and I like it much above all my other
attempts at story-telling; I think it is strange; if ever I
shall make a hit, I have the line now, as I believe.</p>

<p>Fanny has finished one of hers, <i>The Shadow on the Bed</i>,
and is now hammering at a second, for which we have
&ldquo;no name&rdquo; as yet&mdash;not by Wilkie Collins.</p>

<p><i>Tales for Winter Nights.</i> Yes, that, I think, we will
call the lot of them when republished.</p>

<p>Why have you not sent me a testimonial? Everybody
else but you has responded, and Symonds, but I&rsquo;m afraid
he&rsquo;s ill. Do think, too, if anybody else would write me
a testimonial. I am told quantity goes far. I have good
ones from Rev. Professor Campbell, Professor Meiklejohn,
Leslie Stephen, Lang, Gosse, and a very shaky one from
Hamerton.</p>

<p>Grant is an elector, so can&rsquo;t, but has written me kindly.
From Tulloch I have not yet heard. Do help me with
suggestions. This old chair, with its £250 and its light
work, would make me.</p>

<p>It looks as if we should take Cater&rsquo;s chalet<a name="FnAnchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> after all;
but O! to go back to that place, it seems cruel. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>317</span>
not yet received the Landor; but it may be at home,
detained by my mother, who returns to-morrow.</p>

<p>Believe me, dear Colvin, ever yours,</p>

<p class="rt">R. L. S.</p>

<p>Yours came; the class is in summer; many thanks
for the testimonial, it is bully; arrived along with it
another from Symonds, also bully; he is ill, but not
lungs, thank God&mdash;fever got in Italy. We <i>have</i> taken
Cater&rsquo;s chalet; so we are now the aristo&rsquo;s of the valley.
There is no hope for me, but if there were, you would hear
sweetness and light streaming from my lips.</p>

<p>And now, <i>mon bon</i>, I must babble about <i>The Merry
Men</i>, my favourite work. It is a fantastic sonata about
the sea and wrecks. Chapter I. &ldquo;Eilean Aros&ldquo;&mdash;the
island, the roost, the &ldquo;merry men,&rdquo; the three people there
living&mdash;sea superstitions. Chapter II. &ldquo;What the Wreck
had brought to Aros.&rdquo; Eh, boy? what had it? Silver
and clocks and brocades, and what a conscience, what a
mad brain! Chapter III. &ldquo;Past and Present in Sandag
Bay&ldquo;&mdash;the new wreck and the old&mdash;so old&mdash;the Armada
treasure-ship, Sant<span class="sp">ma</span> Trini<span class="sp">d</span>&mdash;the grave in the heather&mdash;strangers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318"></a>318</span>
there. Chapter IV. &ldquo;The Gale&ldquo;&mdash;the doomed
ship&mdash;the storm&mdash;the drunken madman on the head&mdash;cries
in the night. Chapter V. &ldquo;A Man out of the Sea.&rdquo; But
I must not breathe to you my plot. It is, I fancy, my
first real shoot at a story; an odd thing, sir, but, I believe,
my own, though there is a little of Scott&rsquo;s <i>Pirate</i> in it, as
how should there not? He had the root of romance in
such places. Aros is Earraid, where I lived lang syne;<a name="FnAnchor_40" href="#Footnote_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a>
the Ross of Grisapol is the Ross of Mull; Ben Ryan, Ben
More. I have written to the middle of Chapter IV. Like
enough, when it is finished I shall discard all chapterings;
for the thing is written straight through. It must, unhappily,
be re-written&mdash;too well written not to be.</p>

<p>The chair is only three months in summer; that is why
I try for it. If I get it, which I shall not, I should be
independent at once. Sweet thought. I liked your
Byron well; your Berlioz better. No one would remark
these cuts; even I, who was looking for it, knew it not
at all to be a torso. The paper strengthens me in my
recommendation to you to follow Colvin&rsquo;s hint. Give us
an 1830; you will do it well, and the subject smiles widely
on the world:&mdash;</p>

<p>1830: <i>A Chapter of Artistic History</i>, by William Ernest
Henley (or <i>of Social and Artistic History</i>, as the thing
might grow to you). Sir, you might be in the Athenæum
yet with that; and, believe me, you might and would be
far better, the author of a readable book.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Pitlochry, if you please</i> [<i>August</i>], 1881.</p>

<p><span class="scs">Dear Henley</span>,&mdash;To answer a point or two. First, the
Spanish ship was sloop-rigged and clumsy, because she
was fitted out by some private adventurers, not over
wealthy, and glad to take what they could get. Is that
not right? Tell me if you think not. That, at least, was
how I meant it. As for the boat-cloaks, I am afraid they
are, as you say, false imagination; but I love the name,
nature, and being of them so dearly, that I feel as if I
would almost rather ruin a story than omit the reference.
The proudest moments of my life have been passed in
the stern-sheets of a boat with that romantic garment over
my shoulders. This, without prejudice to one glorious
day when standing upon some water stairs at Lerwick I
signalled with my pocket-handkerchief for a boat to come
ashore for me. I was then aged fifteen or sixteen; conceive
my glory.</p>

<p>Several of the phrases you object to are proper nautical,
or long-shore phrases, and therefore, I think, not
out of place in this long-shore story. As for the two
members which you thought at first so ill-united; I
confess they seem perfectly so to me. I have chosen to
sacrifice a long-projected story of adventure because the
sentiment of that is identical with the sentiment of &ldquo;My
uncle.&rdquo; My uncle himself is not the story as I see it, only
the leading episode of that story. It&rsquo;s really a story of
wrecks, as they appear to the dweller on the coast. It&rsquo;s
a view of the sea. Goodness knows when I shall be able
to re-write; I must first get over this copper-headed
cold.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Kinnaird Cottage, Pitlochry, August 1881.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;This is the first letter I have written
this good while. I have had a brutal cold, not perhaps
very wisely treated; lots of blood&mdash;for me, I mean. I
was so well, however, before, that I seem to be sailing
through with it splendidly. My appetite never failed;
indeed, as I got worse, it sharpened&mdash;a sort of reparatory
instinct. Now I feel in a fair way to get round soon.</p>

<p><i>Monday, August</i> (<i>2nd</i>, is it?).&mdash;We set out for the
Spital of Glenshee, and reach Braemar on Tuesday. The
Braemar address we cannot learn; it looks as if &ldquo;Braemar&rdquo;
were all that was necessary; if particular, you can
address 17 Heriot Row. We shall be delighted to see you
whenever, and as soon as ever, you can make it possible.</p>

<p>... I hope heartily you will survive me, and do not
doubt it. There are seven or eight people it is no part
of my scheme in life to survive&mdash;yet if I could but heal
me of my bellowses, I could have a jolly life&mdash;have it, even
now, when I can work and stroll a little, as I have been
doing till this cold. I have so many things to make life
sweet to me, it seems a pity I cannot have that other
one thing&mdash;health. But though you will be angry to hear
it, I believe, for myself at least, what is is best. I believed
it all through my worst days, and I am not ashamed to
profess it now.</p>

<p>Landor has just turned up; but I had read him already.
I like him extremely; I wonder if the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo;
were perhaps not advantageous. It seems quite full
enough; but then you know I am a compressionist.</p>

<p>If I am to criticise, it is a little staid; but the classical
is apt to look so. It is in curious contrast to that inexpressive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321"></a>321</span>
unplanned wilderness of Forster&rsquo;s; clear,
readable, precise, and sufficiently human. I see nothing
lost in it, though I could have wished, in my Scotch capacity,
a trifle clearer and fuller exposition of his moral
attitude, which is not quite clear &ldquo;from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He and his tyrannicide! I am in a mad fury about
these explosions. If that is the new world! Damn
O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa; damn him behind and before, above,
below, and roundabout; damn, deracinate, and destroy
him, root and branch, self and company, world without
end. Amen. I write that for sport if you like, but I
will pray in earnest, O Lord, if you cannot convert, kindly
delete him!</p>

<p>Stories naturally at halt. Henley has seen one and
approves. I believe it to be good myself, even real good.
He has also seen and approved one of Fanny&rsquo;s. It will
make a good volume. We have now</p>

<p>Dr. Japp (known in literature at this date and for some time
afterwards under his pseudonym H. A. Page; later under his own
name the biographer of De Quincey) had written to R. L. S. criticising
statements of fact and opinion in his essay on Thoreau, and
expressing the hope that they might meet and discuss their differences.
In the interval between the last letter and this Stevenson

</div>

<p class="rt"><i>The Cottage, Castleton of Braemar</i>,
<i>Sunday</i> [<i>August 1881</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;I should long ago have written to
thank you for your kind and frank letter; but in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>322</span>
state of health papers are apt to get mislaid, and your
letter has been vainly hunted for until this (Sunday)
morning.</p>

<p>I regret I shall not be able to see you in Edinburgh;
one visit to Edinburgh has already cost me too dear in
that invaluable particular health; but if it should be at all
possible for you to push on as far as Braemar, I believe
you would find an attentive listener, and I can offer you
a bed, a drive, and necessary food, etc.</p>

<p>If, however, you should not be able to come thus far,
I can promise you two things: First, I shall religiously
revise what I have written, and bring out more clearly
the point of view from which I regarded Thoreau; second,
I shall in the Preface record your objection.</p>

<p>The point of view (and I must ask you not to forget
that any such short paper is essentially only a <i>section
through</i> a man) was this: I desired to look at the man
through his books. Thus, for instance, when I mentioned
his return to the pencil-making, I did it only in passing
(perhaps I was wrong), because it seemed to me not an
illustration of his principles, but a brave departure from
them. Thousands of such there were I do not doubt;
still, they might be hardly to my purpose, though, as you
say so, some of them would be.</p>

<p>Our difference as to pity I suspect was a logomachy
of my making. No pitiful acts on his part would surprise
me; I know he would be more pitiful in practice than
most of the whiners; but the spirit of that practice would
still seem to be unjustly described by the word pity.</p>

<p>When I try to be measured, I find myself usually suspected
of a sneaking unkindness for my subject; but you
may be sure, sir, I would give up most other things to be
so good a man as Thoreau. Even my knowledge of him
leads me thus far.</p>

<p>Should you find yourself able to push on to Braemar&mdash;it
may even be on your way&mdash;believe me, your visit will
be most welcome. The weather is cruel, but the place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"></a>323</span>
is, as I dare say you know, the very &ldquo;wale&rdquo; of Scotland&mdash;bar
Tummelside.&mdash;Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p><span class="sc">... Well</span>, I have been pretty mean, but I have not
yet got over my cold so completely as to have recovered
much energy. It is really extraordinary that I should
have recovered as well as I have in this blighting weather;
the wind pipes, the rain comes in squalls, great black
clouds are continually overhead, and it is as cold as
March. The country is delightful, more cannot be said; it
is very beautiful, a perfect joy when we get a blink of sun
to see it in. The Queen knows a thing or two, I perceive;
she has picked out the finest habitable spot in Britain.</p>

<p>I have done no work, and scarce written a letter for
three weeks, but I think I should soon begin again; my
cough is now very trifling. I eat well, and seem to have lost
but little flesh in the meanwhile. I was <i>wonderfully</i> well before
I caught this horrid cold. I never thought I should
have been as well again; I really enjoyed life and work; and,
of course, I now have a good hope that this may return.</p>

<p>I suppose you heard of our ghost stories. They are
somewhat delayed by my cold and a bad attack of laziness,
embroidery, etc., under which Fanny had been
some time prostrate. It is horrid that we can get no
better weather. I did not get such good accounts of
you as might have been. You must imitate me. I am
now one of the most conscientious people at trying to get
better you ever saw. I have a white hat, it is much

of Fortune sent off to you by this day&rsquo;s post a P.C. inviting
you to appear in sealskin. But this had reference to the
weather, and not at all, as you may have been led to fancy,
to our rustic raiment of an evening.</p>

<p>As to that question, I would deal, in so far as in me
lies, fairly with all men. We are not dressy people by
nature; but it sometimes occurs to us to entertain angels.
In the country, I believe, even angels may be decently
welcomed in tweed; I have faced many great personages,
for my own part, in a tasteful suit of sea-cloth with an
end of carpet pending from my gullet. Still, we do
maybe twice a summer burst out in the direction of blacks&mdash;and
yet we do it seldom. In short, let your own heart
decide, and the capacity of your portmanteau. If you came
in camel&rsquo;s hair, you would still, although conspicuous, be
welcome.</p>

<p>The following records the beginning of work upon <i>Treasure
Island</i>, the name originally proposed for which was <i>The Sea Cook</i>:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Braemar, August 25, 1881.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;Of course I am a rogue. Why,
Lord, it&rsquo;s known, man; but you should remember I have
had a horrid cold. Now, I&rsquo;m better, I think; and see
here&mdash;nobody, not you, nor Lang, nor the devil, will
hurry me with our crawlers. They are coming. Four of
them are as good as done, and the rest will come when
ripe; but I am now on another lay for the moment, purely
owing to Lloyd, this one; but I believe there&rsquo;s more
coin in it than in any amount of crawlers: now, see
here, <i>The Sea Cook, or Treasure Island: A Story for
Boys</i>.</p>

<p>If this don&rsquo;t fetch the kids, why, they have gone
rotten since my day. Will you be surprised to learn that
it is about Buccaneers, that it begins in the &ldquo;Admiral
Benbow&rdquo; public-house on Devon coast, that it&rsquo;s all about
a map, and a treasure, and a mutiny, and a derelict ship,
and a current, and a fine old Squire Trelawney (the real
Tre, purged of literature and sin, to suit the infant mind),
and a doctor, and another doctor, and a sea cook with
one leg, and a sea-song with the chorus &ldquo;Yo-ho-ho and a
bottle of rum&rdquo; (at the third Ho you heave at the capstan
bars), which is a real buccaneer&rsquo;s song, only known
to the crew of the late Captain Flint (died of rum at Key
West, much regretted, friends will please accept this
intimation); and lastly, would you be surprised to hear,
in this connection, the name of <i>Routledge</i>? That&rsquo;s the
kind of man I am, blast your eyes. Two chapters are
written, and have been tried on Lloyd with great success;
the trouble is to work it off without oaths. Buccaneers
without oaths&mdash;bricks without straw. But youth and the
fond <span class="correction" title="originally printed as 'parient'">parent</span> have to be consulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>327</span></p>

<p>And now look here&mdash;this is next day&mdash;and three
chapters are written and read. (Chapter I. The Old Sea-dog
at the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow.&rdquo; Chapter II. Black Dog
appears and disappears. Chapter III. The Black Spot.)
All now heard by Lloyd, F., and my father and mother,
with high approval. It&rsquo;s quite silly and horrid fun, and
what I want is the <i>best</i> book about the Buccaneers that
can be had&mdash;the latter B&rsquo;s above all, Blackbeard and
sich, and get Nutt or Bain to send it skimming by the
fastest post. And now I know you&rsquo;ll write to me, for
<i>The Sea Cook&rsquo;s</i> sake.</p>

<p>Your Admiral Guinea is curiously near my line, but of
course I&rsquo;m fooling; and your Admiral sounds like a
shublime gent, Stick to him like wax&mdash;he&rsquo;ll do. My
Trelawney is, as I indicate, several thousand sea-miles off
the lie of the original or your Admiral Guinea; and
besides, I have no more about him yet but one mention of
his name, and I think it likely he may turn yet farther
from the model in the course of handling. A chapter a
day I mean to do; they are short; and perhaps in a
month <i>The Sea Cook</i> may to Routledge go, yo-ho-ho and
a bottle of rum! My Trelawney has a strong dash of
Landor, as I see him from here. No women in the story,
Lloyd&rsquo;s orders; and who so blithe to obey? It&rsquo;s awful
fun boys&rsquo; stories; you just indulge the pleasure of your
heart, that&rsquo;s all; no trouble, no strain. The only stiff
thing is to get it ended&mdash;that I don&rsquo;t see, but I look to a
volcano. O sweet, O generous, O human toils. You
would like my blind beggar in Chapter III. I believe; no
writing, just drive along as the words come and the pen
will scratch!</p>

<p>This tells of the farther progress of <i>Treasure Island</i>, of the price
paid for it, and of the modest hopes with which it was launched.
&ldquo;The poet&rdquo; is Mr. Gosse. The project of a highway story, <i>Jerry
Abershaw</i>, remained a favourite one with Stevenson until it was
superseded three or four years later by another, that of the <i>Great
North Road</i>, which in its turn had to be abandoned, from lack of
health and leisure, after some six or eight chapters had been written.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>Braemar, September 1881.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;Thanks for your last. The £100
fell through, or dwindled at least into somewhere about
£30. However, that I&rsquo;ve taken as a mouthful, so you
may look out for <i>The Sea Cook, or Treasure Island: A
Tale of the Buccaneers</i>, in Young Folks. (The terms are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>329</span>
£2, 10s. a page of 4500 words; that&rsquo;s not noble, is it?
But I have my copyright safe. I don&rsquo;t get illustrated&mdash;a
blessing; that&rsquo;s the price I have to pay for my
copyright.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll make this boys&rsquo; book business pay; but I have to
make a beginning. When I&rsquo;m done with Young Folks,
I&rsquo;ll try Routledge or some one. I feel pretty sure the
<i>Sea Cook</i> will do to reprint, and bring something decent
at that.</p>

<p>Japp is a good soul. The poet was very gay and
pleasant. He told me much: he is simply the most active
young man in England, and one of the most intelligent.
&ldquo;He shall o&rsquo;er Europe, shall o&rsquo;er earth extend.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_41" href="#Footnote_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> He is
now extending over adjacent parts of Scotland.</p>

<p>I propose to follow up <i>The Sea Cook</i> at proper intervals
by <i>Jerry Abershaw: A Tale of Putney Heath</i> (which or
its site I must visit): <i>The Leading Light: A Tale of the
Coast</i>, <i>The Squaw Men: or the Wild West</i>, and other
instructive and entertaining work. <i>Jerry Abershaw</i> should
be good, eh? I love writing boys&rsquo; books. This first is
only an experiment; wait till you see what I can make
&rsquo;em with my hand in. I&rsquo;ll be the Harrison Ainsworth
of the future; and a chalk better by St. Christopher; or
at least as good. You&rsquo;ll see that even by <i>The Sea Cook</i>.</p>

<p>Jerry Abershaw&mdash;O what a title! Jerry Abershaw:
d&mdash;n it, sir, it&rsquo;s a poem. The two most lovely words in
English; and what a sentiment! Hark you, how the
hoofs ring! Is this a blacksmith&rsquo;s? No, it&rsquo;s a wayside
inn. Jerry Abershaw. &ldquo;It was a clear, frosty evening,
not 100 miles from Putney,&rdquo; etc. Jerry Abershaw. Jerry
Abershaw. Jerry Abershaw. <i>The Sea Cook</i> is now in
its sixteenth chapter, and bids for well up in the thirties.
Each three chapters is worth £2, 10s. So we&rsquo;ve £12, 10s.
already.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t read Marryat&rsquo;s <i>Pirate</i> anyhow; it is written in
sand with a salt-spoon: arid, feeble, vain, tottering production.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>330</span>
But then we&rsquo;re not always all there. <i>He</i> was
<i>all</i> somewhere else that trip. It&rsquo;s <i>damnable</i>, Henley. I
don&rsquo;t go much on <i>The Sea Cook</i>; but, Lord, it&rsquo;s a little
fruitier than the <i>Pirate</i> by Cap&rsquo;n. Marryat.</p>

<p>Since this was written <i>The Cook</i> is in his nineteenth
chapter. Yo-heave ho!</p>

excuses, however, are many and not pleasant. Almost
immediately after I last wrote to you, I had a hemorreage
(I can&rsquo;t spell it), was badly treated by a doctor in the
country, and have been a long while picking up&mdash;still, in
fact, have much to desire on that side. Next, as soon as
I got here, my wife took ill; she is, I fear, seriously so;
and this combination of two invalids very much depresses
both.</p>

<p>I have a volume of republished essays coming out

my wife might have the reviews to divert her. Otherwise
my news is <i>nil</i>. I am up here in a little chalet, on the
borders of a pinewood, overlooking a great part of the
Davos Thal, a beautiful scene at night, with the moon
upon the snowy mountains, and the lights warmly shining
in the village. J. A. Symonds is next door to me, just

so much for that. On the other hand, it led me to take
quite a particular pleasure in asking you to give it; and
so much for the other. I trust, even if you cannot share
it, you will understand my view.</p>

<p>I am in treaty with Bentley for a life of Hazlitt; I hope
it will not fall through, as I love the subject, and appear

makes things more pleasant. You know I am a fervent
Hazlittite; I mean regarding him as <i>the</i> English writer

alone with my weasel-dog and my German maid, on the
top of a hill here, heavy mist and thin snow all about
me, and the devil to pay in general. I don&rsquo;t care so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>337</span>
much for solitude as I used to; results, I suppose, of
marriage.</p>

<p>Pray write me something cheery. A little Edinburgh
gossip, in Heaven&rsquo;s name. Ah! what would I not give
to steal this evening with you through the big, echoing,
college archway, and away south under the street lamps,
and away to dear Brash&rsquo;s, now defunct! But the old
time is dead also, never, never to revive. It was a sad
time too, but so gay and so hopeful, and we had such
sport with all our low spirits and all our distresses, that it
looks like a kind of lamplit fairyland behind me. O for
ten Edinburgh minutes&mdash;sixpence between us, and the
ever-glorious Lothian Road, or dear mysterious Leith
Walk! But here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling;
here in this strange place, whose very strangeness would
have been heaven to him then; and aspires, yes, C. B.,
with tears, after the past. See what comes of being left
alone. Do you remember Brash? the sheet of glass that
we followed along George Street? Granton? the night
at Bonny mainhead? the compass near the sign of the
<i>Twinkling Eye</i>? the night I lay on the pavement in
misery?</p>

<p class="rt"><i>Chalet Buol, Davos-Platz, December 26, 1881.</i></p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR MOTHER</span>,&mdash;Yesterday, Sunday and Christmas,
we finished this eventful journey by a drive in an <i>open</i>
sleigh&mdash;none others were to be had&mdash;seven hours on end
through whole forests of Christmas trees. The cold was
beyond belief. I have often suffered less at a dentist&rsquo;s.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>338</span>
It was a clear, sunny day, but the sun even at noon falls,
at this season, only here and there into the Prättigau.
I kept up as long as I could in an imitation of a street
singer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f80">&ldquo;Away, ye gay landscapes, ye gardens of roses,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>At last Lloyd remarked, a blue mouth speaking from a
corpse-coloured face, &ldquo;You seem to be the only one with
any courage left?&rdquo; And, do you know, with that word
my courage disappeared, and I made the rest of the stage
in the same dumb wretchedness as the others. My only
terror was lest Fanny should ask for brandy, or laudanum,
or something. So awful was the idea of putting my hands
out, that I half thought I would refuse.</p>

<p>Well, none of us are a penny the worse, Lloyd&rsquo;s cold
better; I, with a twinge of the rheumatiz; and Fanny
better than her ordinary.</p>

<p>General conclusion between Lloyd and me as to the
journey: A prolonged visit to the dentist&rsquo;s, complicated
with the fear of death.</p>

<p>Never, O never, do you get me there again.&mdash;Ever

<p>Mr. Gosse and R. L. S. had proposed to Mr. R. W. Gilder, of

he had accepted the proposal on terms which they thought liberal.</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR GOSSE</span>,&mdash;I have just brought my wife back,
through such cold, in an open sleigh too, as I had never
fancied to exist. I won&rsquo;t use the word torture, but go to
your dentist&rsquo;s and in nine cases out of ten you will not
suffer more pain than we suffered.</p>

<p>This is merely in acknowledgment of your editorial:
to say that I shall give my mind at once to the Murder.
But I bethink me you can say so much and convey my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>339</span>
sense of the liberality of our Cousins, without exhibiting
this scrawl. So I may go on to tell you that I have at
last found a publisher as eager to publish, as I am to
write a Hazlitt. Bentley is the Boy; and very liberal,
at least, as per last advices; certainly very friendly and
eager, which makes work light, like whistling. I wish I
was with the rest of&mdash;well, of us&mdash;in the red books. But
I am glad to get a whack at Hazlitt, howsoe&rsquo;er.</p>

<p>How goes your Gray? I would not change with you;
brother! Gray would never be suited to my temperament,
while Hazlitt fits me like a glove.</p>

<p>I hope in your studies in Young Folks you did not
miss the delicious reticences, the artistic concealments,
and general fine-shade graduation, through which the fact
of the Xmas Nr. being 3d. was instilled&mdash;too strong&mdash;inspired
into the mind of the readers. It was superb.</p>

sometime in May, perhaps before; it depends on Fanny&rsquo;s

<p>In the early months of this year a hurt knee kept Stevenson
more indoors than was good for him.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Chalet am Stein, Davos-Platz, February 1882.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;Here comes the letter as promised
last night. And first two requests: Pray send the enclosed
to c/o Blackmore&rsquo;s publisher, &rsquo;tis from Fanny;
second, pray send us Routledge&rsquo;s shilling book, Edward
Mayhew&rsquo;s <i>Dogs</i>, by return if it can be managed.</p>

<p>Our dog is very ill again, poor fellow, looks very ill too,
only sleeps at night because of morphine; and we do not
know what ails him, only fear it to be canker of the ear.
He makes a bad, black spot in our life, poor, selfish, silly,
little tangle; and my wife is wretched. Otherwise she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342"></a>342</span>
better, steadily and slowly moving up through all her
relapses. My knee never gets the least better; it hurts
to-night, which it has not done for long. I do not suppose
my doctor knows any least thing about it. He says it
is a nerve that I struck, but I assure you he does not know.</p>

<p>I have just finished a paper, <i>A Gossip on Romance</i>, in
which I have tried to do, very popularly, about one-half
of the matter you wanted me to try. In a way, I have
found an answer to the question. But the subject was
hardly fit for so chatty a paper, and it is all loose ends.
If ever I do my book on the Art of Literature, I shall
gather them together and be clear.</p>

<p>To-morrow, having once finished off the touches still
due on this, I shall tackle <i>San Francisco</i> for you. Then
the tide of work will fairly bury me, lost to view and
hope. You have no idea what it costs me to wring out
my work now. I have certainly been a fortnight over
this <i>Romance</i>, sometimes five hours a day; and yet it is
about my usual length&mdash;eight pages or so, and would be
a d&mdash;&mdash;d sight the better for another curry. But I do not
think I can honestly re-write it all; so I call it done,
and shall only straighten words in a revision currently.</p>

<p>The following flight of fancy refers to supposed errors of judgment
on the part of an eminent firm of publishers, with whom
Stevenson had at this time no connection. Very soon afterwards
he entered into relations with them which proved equally pleasant
and profitable to both parties, and were continued on the most
cordial terms until his death.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Chalet am Stein, Davos, March 1882.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR HENLEY</span>,&mdash;Last night we had a dinner-party,
consisting of the John Addington, curry, onions (lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343"></a>343</span>
onions), and beefsteak. So unusual is any excitement,
that F. and I feel this morning as if we had been to a
coronation. However I must, I suppose, write.</p>

<p>I was sorry about your female contributor squabble.
&rsquo;Tis very comic, but really unpleasant. But what care I?
Now that I illustrate my own books, I can always offer
you a situation in our house&mdash;S. L. Osbourne and Co. As
an author gets a halfpenny a copy of verses, and an artist
a penny a cut, perhaps a proof-reader might get several
pounds a year.</p>

<p>O that Coronation! What a shouting crowd there
was! I obviously got a firework in each eye. The king
looked very magnificent, to be sure; and that great hall
where we feasted on seven hundred delicate foods, and
drank fifty royal wines&mdash;<i>quel coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i>! but was it not
overdone, even for a coronation&mdash;almost a vulgar luxury?
And eleven is certainly too late to begin dinner. (It was
really 6.30 instead of 5.30.)</p>

<p>Your list of books that Cassells have refused in these
weeks is not quite complete; they also refused:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Six undiscovered Tragedies, one romantic Comedy,
a fragment of Journal extending over six years, and an
unfinished Autobiography reaching up to the first performance
of King John. By William Shakespeare.</p>

<p>2. The Journals and Private Correspondence of David,
King of Israel.</p>

<p>3. Poetical Works of Arthur, Iron Dook of Wellington
including a Monody on Napoleon.</p>

<p>4. Eight books of an unfinished novel, <i>Solomon Crabb</i>.
By Henry Fielding.</p>

<p>5. Stevenson&rsquo;s Moral Emblems.</p>

<p>You also neglected to mention, as <i>per contra</i>, that they
had during the same time accepted and triumphantly
published Brown&rsquo;s <i>Handbook to Cricket</i>, <i>Jones&rsquo;s First
French Reader</i>, and Robinson&rsquo;s <i>Picturesque Cheshire</i>, uniform
with the same author&rsquo;s <i>Stately Homes of Salop</i>.</p>

<p>O if that list could come true! How we would tear at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>344</span>
<i>Solomon Crabb</i>! O what a bully, bully, bully business.
Which would you read first&mdash;Shakespeare&rsquo;s autobiography,
or his journals? What sport the monody on
Napoleon would be&mdash;what wooden verse, what stucco
ornament! I should read both the autobiography and
the journals before I looked at one of the plays, beyond
the names of them, which shows that Saintsbury was
right, and I do care more for life than for poetry. No&mdash;I
take it back. Do you know one of the tragedies&mdash;a
Bible tragedy too&mdash;<i>David</i>&mdash;was written in his third period&mdash;much
about the same time as Lear? The comedy,
<i>April Rain</i>, is also a late work. <i>Beckett</i> is a fine ranting
piece, like <i>Richard II.</i>, but very fine for the stage. Irving
is to play it this autumn when I&rsquo;m in town; the part
rather suits him&mdash;but who is to play Henry&mdash;a tremendous
creation, sir. Betterton in his private journal seems
to have seen this piece; and he says distinctly that Henry
is the best part in any play. &ldquo;Though,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;how
it be with the ancient plays I know not. But in this I
have ever feared to do ill, and indeed will not be persuaded
to that undertaking.&rdquo; So says Betterton. <i>Rufus</i> is not
so good; I am not pleased with <i>Rufus</i>; plainly a <i>rifaccimento</i>
of some inferior work; but there are some damned
fine lines. As for the purely satiric ill-minded <i>Abelard and
Heloise</i>, another <i>Troilus, quoi!</i> it is not pleasant, truly,
but what strength, what verve, what knowledge of life,
and the Canon! What a finished, humorous, rich picture
is the Canon! Ah, there was nobody like Shakespeare.
But what I like is the David and Absalom business:
Absalom is so well felt&mdash;you love him as David did;
David&rsquo;s speech is one roll of royal music from the first
act to the fifth.</p>

<p>I am enjoying <i>Solomon Crabb</i> extremely; Solomon&rsquo;s
capital adventure with the two highwaymen and Squire
Trecothick and Parson Vance; it is as good, I think, as
anything in Joseph Andrews. I have just come to the
part where the highwayman with the black patch over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>345</span>
his eye has tricked poor Solomon into his place, and the
squire and the parson are hearing the evidence. Parson
Vance is splendid. How good, too, is old Mrs. Crabb and
the coastguardsman in the third chapter, or her delightful
quarrel with the sexton of Seaham; Lord Conybeare is
surely a little overdone; but I don&rsquo;t know either; he&rsquo;s
such damned fine sport. Do you like Sally Barnes? I&rsquo;m
in love with her. Constable Muddon is as good as Dogberry
and Verges put together; when he takes Solomon to the
cage, and the highwayman gives him Solomon&rsquo;s own
guinea for his pains, and kisses Mrs. Muddon, and just then
up drives Lord Conybeare, and instead of helping Solomon,
calls him all the rascals in Christendom&mdash;O Henry Fielding,
Henry Fielding! Yet perhaps the scenes at Seaham
are the best. But I&rsquo;m bewildered among all these excellences.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The following is in reply to a letter Stevenson had received on
some questions connected with his proposed Life of Hazlitt from
the veteran critic and bibliographer since deceased, Mr. Alexander
Ireland. At the foot is to be found the first reference to his new
amusement of wood engraving for the Davos Press:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="rt">[<i>Chalet am Stein, Davos, March 1882.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;This formidable paper need not alarm
you; it argues nothing beyond penury of other sorts, and
is not at all likely to lead me into a long letter. If I
were at all grateful it would, for yours has just passed for
me a considerable part of a stormy evening. And speaking
of gratitude, let me at once and with becoming eagerness
accept your kind invitation to Bowdon. I shall
hope, if we can agree as to dates when I am nearer hand,
to come to you sometime in the month of May. I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>346</span>
pleased to hear you were a Scot; I feel more at home
with my compatriots always; perhaps the more we are
away, the stronger we feel that bond.</p>

<p>You ask about Davos; I have discoursed about it
already, rather sillily I think, in the <i>Pall Mall</i>, and I mean
to say no more, but the ways of the Muse are dubious and
obscure, and who knows? I may be wiled again. As a
place of residence, beyond a splendid climate, it has to
my eyes but one advantage&mdash;the neighbourhood of J. A.
Symonds&mdash;I dare say you know his work, but the man is
far more interesting. It has done me, in my two winters&rsquo;
Alpine exile, much good; so much, that I hope to leave
it now for ever, but would not be understood to boast. In
my present unpardonably crazy state, any cold might
send me skipping, either back to Davos, or further off.
Let us hope not. It is dear; a little dreary; very far
from many things that both my taste and my needs prompt
me to seek; and altogether not the place that I should
choose of my free will.</p>

<p>I am chilled by your description of the man in question,
though I had almost argued so much from his cold
and undigested volume. If the republication does not
interfere with my publisher, it will not interfere with
me; but there, of course, comes the hitch. I do not know
Mr. Bentley, and I fear all publishers like the devil from
legend and experience both. However, when I come to
town, we shall, I hope, meet and understand each other
as well as author and publisher ever do. I liked his
letters; they seemed hearty, kind, and personal. Still&mdash;I
am notedly suspicious of the trade&mdash;your news of this
republication alarms me.</p>

<p>The best of the present French novelists seems to me,
incomparably, Daudet. <i>Les Rois en Exil</i> comes very near
being a masterpiece. For Zola I have no toleration,
though the curious, eminently bourgeois, and eminently
French creature has power of a kind. But I would he were
deleted. I would not give a chapter of old Dumas (meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>347</span>
himself, not his collaborators) for the whole boiling of
the Zolas. Romance with the smallpox&mdash;as the great
one: diseased anyway and blackhearted and fundamentally
at enmity with joy.</p>

<p>I trust that Mrs. Ireland does not object to smoking;
and if you are a teetotaller, I beg you to mention it before
I come&mdash;I have all the vices; some of the virtues also,
let us hope&mdash;that, at least, of being a Scotchman, and
yours very sincerely,</p>

the author&rsquo;s attitude. Not one incident holds with
another from beginning to end; and whenever I discover
a new inconsistency, Sam is the first to laugh&mdash;with a

<p><span class="scs">DEAR COLVIN</span>,&mdash;About Keats&mdash;well yes, I wonder; I
see all your difficulties and yet, I have the strongest kind
of feeling that critical biography is your real vein. The
Landor was one nail; another, I think, would be good
for you and the public. Indeed I would do the Keats. He
is worth doing; it is a brave and a sad little story, and
the critical part lies deep in the very vitals of art. All
summed, I would do him; remember it is but a small
order alongside of Landor; and £100, and kudos, and a
good word for the poor, great lad, who will otherwise fall
among the molluscs. Up, heart! give me a John Keats!
Houghton, though he has done it with grace, has scarce
done it with grip.</p>

<p>I have put you into <i>Talk and Talkers</i> sure enough.
God knows, I hope I shall offend nobody; I do begin to
quake mightily over that paper. I have a <i>Gossip on
Romance</i> about done; it puts some real criticism in a
light way, I think. It is destined for Longman who (dead
secret) is bringing out a new Mag. (6d.) in the Autumn.
Dead Secret: all his letters are three deep with masks
and passwords, and I swear on a skull daily. F. has reread
<i>Treasure I<span class="sp">d</span>.</i>, against which she protested; and now
she thinks the end about as good as the beginning; only
some six chapters situate about the midst of the tale to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350"></a>350</span>
be rewritten. This sounds hopefuller. My new long

(bard, rather) and hartis on wood. The cut represents
the Hero and the Eagle, and is emblematic of Cortez first
viewing the Pacific Ocean, which (according to the bard
Keats) it took place in Darien. The cut is much admired
for the sentiment of discovery, the manly proportions of
the voyager, and the fine impression of tropical scenes
and the untrodden <span class="sc">WASTE</span>, so aptly rendered by the hartis.</p>

<p>I would send you the book; but I declare I&rsquo;m ruined.

<p><span class="scs">MY DEAR DR. JAPP</span>,&mdash;A good day to date this letter,
which is in fact a confession of incapacity. During my
wife&rsquo;s illness I somewhat lost my head, and entirely lost
a great quire of corrected proofs. This is one of the
results; I hope there are none more serious. I was never
so sick of any volume as I was of that; I was continually
receiving fresh proofs with fresh infinitesimal difficulties.
I was ill&mdash;I did really fear my wife was worse than ill.
Well, it&rsquo;s out now; and though I have observed several
carelessnesses myself, and now here&rsquo;s another of your
finding&mdash;of which, indeed, I ought to be ashamed&mdash;it will
only justify the sweeping humility of the Preface.</p>

<p>Symonds was actually dining with us when your letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352"></a>352</span>
came, and I communicated your remarks.... He is a
far better and more interesting thing than any of his
books.</p>

<p>The Elephant was my wife&rsquo;s; so she is proportionately
elate you should have picked it out for praise&mdash;from a
collection, let me add, so replete with the highest qualities
of art.</p>

<p>My wicked carcase, as John Knox calls it, holds together
wonderfully. In addition to many other things,
and a volume of travel, I find I have written, since
December, 90 Cornhill pages of magazine work&mdash;essays
and stories: 40,000 words, and I am none the worse&mdash;I
am the better. I begin to hope I may, if not outlive this
wolverine upon my shoulders, at least carry him bravely
like Symonds and Alexander Pope. I begin to take a
pride in that hope.</p>

<p>I shall be much interested to see your criticisms; you
might perhaps send them to me. I believe you know that
is not dangerous; one folly I have not&mdash;I am not touchy
under criticism.</p>

<p>Lloyd and my wife both beg to be remembered; and
Lloyd sends as a present a work of his own. I hope you

<p>There remain: C. B., the Williamses&mdash;you know they
were the parties who stuck up for us about our marriage,
and Mrs. W. was my guardian angel, and our Best Man
and Bridesmaid rolled in one, and the only third of the
wedding party&mdash;my sister-in-law, who is booked for
<i>Prince Otto</i>&mdash;Jenkin I suppose some time&mdash;George Meredith,
the only man of genius of my acquaintance, and then I
believe I&rsquo;ll have to take to the dead, the immortal memory
business.</p>

<p>Talking of Meredith, I have just re-read for the third
and fourth time <i>The Egoist</i>. When I shall have read it
the sixth or seventh, I begin to see I shall know about it.
You will be astonished when you come to re-read it; I
had no idea of the matter&mdash;human, red matter he has
contrived to plug and pack into that strange and admirable
book. Willoughby is, of course, a pure discovery;
a complete set of nerves, not heretofore examined, and
yet running all over the human body&mdash;a suit of nerves.
Clara is the best girl ever I saw anywhere. Vernon is
almost as good. The manner and the faults of the book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>354</span>
greatly justify themselves on further study. Only Dr.
Middleton does not hang together; and Ladies Busshe
and Culmer <i>sont des monstruosités</i>. Vernon&rsquo;s conduct
makes a wonderful odd contrast with Daniel Deronda&rsquo;s.
I see more and more that Meredith is built for immortality.</p>

<p>Talking of which, Heywood, as a small immortal, an
immortalet, claims some attention. <i>The Woman killed
with Kindness</i> is one of the most striking novels&mdash;not
plays, though it&rsquo;s more of a play than anything else of his&mdash;I
ever read. He had such a sweet, sound soul, the old
boy. The death of the two pirates in <i>Fortune by Sea and
Land</i> is a document. He had obviously been present, and
heard Purser and Clinton take death by the beard with
similar braggadocios. Purser and Clinton, names of
pirates; Scarlet and Bobbington, names of highwaymen.
He had the touch of names, I think. No man I ever
knew had such a sense, such a tact, for English nomenclature:
Rainsforth, Lacy, Audley, Forrest, Acton,
Spencer, Frankford&mdash;so his names run.</p>

<p>Byron not only wrote <i>Don Juan</i>; he called Joan of
Arc &ldquo;a fanatical strumpet.&rdquo; These are his words. I
think the double shame, first to a great poet, second to
an English noble, passes words.</p>

<p>My dear mother, how can I keep up with your breathless
changes? Innerleithen, Cramond, Bridge of Allan,
Dunblane, Selkirk. I lean to Cramond, but I shall be
pleased anywhere, any respite from Davos; never mind,
it has been a good, though a dear lesson. Now, with my
improved health, if I can pass the summer, I believe I
shall be able no more to exceed, no more to draw on you.
It is time I sufficed for myself indeed. And I believe I
can.</p>

<p>I am still far from satisfied about Fanny; she is
certainly better, but it is by fits a good deal, and the
symptoms continue, which should not be. I had her
persuaded to leave without me this very day (Saturday
8th), but the disclosure of my mismanagement broke up
that plan; she would not leave me lest I should mismanage
more. I think this an unfair revenge; but I
have been so bothered that I cannot struggle. All Davos
has been drinking our wine. During the month of March,
three litres a day were drunk&mdash;O it is too sickening&mdash;and
that is only a specimen. It is enough to make any one
a misanthrope, but the right thing is to hate the donkey
that was duped&mdash;which I devoutly do.</p>

<p>I have this winter finished <i>Treasure Island</i>, written
the preface to the <i>Studies</i>, a small book about the <i>Inland
Voyage</i> size, <i>The Silverado Squatters</i>, and over and above
that upwards of ninety (90) Cornhill pages of magazine
work. No man can say I have been idle.&mdash;Your affectionate

communication by same mail from my mother, clamouring
for news, which I must answer as soon as I&rsquo;ve done
this. Of course, I shall paint your game in lively colours.</p>

<p>I hope to get away from here&mdash;let me not speak of it
ungratefully&mdash;from here&mdash;by Thursday at latest. I am
indeed much better; but a slip of the foot may still cast me
back. I must walk circumspectly yet awhile. But O to be
able to go out and get wet, and not spit blood next day!</p>

<p>Yes, I remember the <i>enfantement</i> of the Arabian Nights;
the first idea of all was the handsome cabs, which I communicated
to you in St. Leonard&rsquo;s Terrace drawing-room.
That same afternoon the Prince de Galles and the
Suicide Club were invented; and several more now forgotten.
I must try to start &rsquo;em again.</p>

<p>Lloyd I believe is to be a printer&mdash;in the meantime
he confines himself to being an expense. He is a first-rate
lad for all that. He is now interrupting me about twice
to the line, which does not condooce to clarity, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

<p>Fanny is still far from well, quite far from well. My
faith is in the Pirate.</p>

<p>I enclose all my artistic works; they are woodcuts&mdash;I
cut them with a knife out of blocks of wood: I am a
wood-engraver; I aaaam a wooooood engraaaaver. Lloyd
then prints &rsquo;em: are they not fun? I doat on them; in
my next venture, I am going to have colour printing; it
will be very laborious, six blocks to cut for each picter,
but the result would be pyramidal.</p>

<p>If I get through the summer, I settle in Autumn in
le pays de France; I believe in the Brittany and become
a <i>Snoozer</i>. You will come and snooze awhile won&rsquo;t you,
and try and get Louisa to join.</p>

<p>Pepys was a decent fellow; singularly like Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357"></a>357</span>
Baxter, by the way, in every character of mind and taste,
and not unlike him in face. I did not mean I had been
too just to him but not just enough to bigger swells. I
would rather have <i>known</i> Pepys than the whole jing-bang;
I doat on him as a card to know.</p>

<p>We shall be pretty poor at the start, of course, but I
guess we can haul through. Only intending visitors to
the Brittannic Castle must not look for nightingales&rsquo;
tongues. When next you see the form of the jeune et
beau pray give him my love, when I come to Weybridge,
I&rsquo;ll hope to see him.&mdash;Ever yours affectionately,</p>

<p>The few remaining letters of this period are dated from Edinburgh
and from Stobo Manse, near Peebles. This, in the matter
of weather and health, was the most disappointing of all Stevenson&rsquo;s
attempts at summer residence in Scotland. Before going to Stobo
he made a short excursion with his father to Lochearnhead; and
later spent some three weeks with me at Kingussie, but from neither
place wrote any letters worth preserving. The following was
addressed to a young art-student who had read the works of Walt
Whitman after reading Stevenson&rsquo;s essay on him, and being staggered
by some things he found there had written asking for further
comment and counsel.</p>
</div>

<p class="rt"><i>17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh</i> [<i>June 1882</i>].</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR SIR</span>,&mdash;If I have in any way disquieted you, I
believe you are justified in bidding me stand and deliver
a remedy if there be one: which is the point.</p>

<p>1st I am of your way of thinking: that a good deal of
Whitman is as well taken once but 2nd I quite believe
that it is better to have everything brought before one in
books. In that way the problems reach us when we are
cool, and not warped by the sophistries of an instant
passion. Life itself presents its problems with a terrible
directness and at the very hour when we are least able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>358</span>
judge calmly. Hence this Pisgah sight of all things, off
the top of a book, is only a rational preparation for the
ugly grips that must follow.</p>

<p>But 3rd, no man can settle another&rsquo;s life for him. It is
the test of the nature and courage of each that he shall
decide it for himself. Each in turn must meet and beard
the Sphynx. Some things however I must say&mdash;and you
will treat them as things read in a book for you to
accept or refuse as you shall see most fit.</p>

<p>Go not out of your way to make difficulties. Hang
back from life while you are young. Shoulder no responsibilities.
You do not yet know how far you can trust
yourself&mdash;it will not be very far, or you are more fortunate
than I am. If you can keep your sexual desires
in order, be glad, be very glad. Some day, when you
meet your fate, you will be free, and the better man.
<i>Don&rsquo;t make a boy and girl friendship that which it is not.</i>
Look at Burns: that is where amourettes conduct an
average good man; and a tepid marriage is only a more
selfish amourette&mdash;in the long run. Whatever you do,
see that you don&rsquo;t sacrifice a woman; that&rsquo;s where all
imperfect loves conduct us. At the same time, if you
can make it convenient to be chaste, for God&rsquo;s sake,
avoid the primness of your virtue; hardness to a poor
harlot is a sin lower than the ugliest unchastity.</p>

<p>Never be in a hurry anyhow.</p>

<p>There is my sermon.</p>

<p>Certainly, you cannot too earnestly go in for the
Greek; and about any art, think last of what pays, first
of what pleases. It is in that spirit only that an art can
be made. Progress in art is made by learning to <i>enjoy</i> it.
That which seems a little dull at first, is found to contain
the elements of pleasure more largely though more quietly
commingled.</p>

<p>I return to my sermon for one more word: Natural
desire gives you no right to any particular woman: that
comes with love only, and don&rsquo;t be too ready to believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359"></a>359</span>
in love: there are many shams: the true love will not
allow you to reason about it.</p>

<p>It is your fault if I appear so pulpiteering.</p>

<p>Wishing you well in life and art, and that you may
long be young.&mdash;Believe me, yours truly,</p>

subject peeps every here and there out of the crannies
like a shy violet&mdash;he could do no more&mdash;and his aroma
hangs there.</p>

<p>I write to catch a minion of the post. Hence brevity.

<p>In the heat of conversation Stevenson was accustomed to invent
any number of fictitious personages, generally Scottish, and to give
them names and to set them playing their imaginary parts in life,
reputable or otherwise. Many of these inventions, including Mr.
Pirbright Smith and Mr. Pegfurth Bannatyne, were a kind of
incarnations of himself, or of special aspects of himself; they
assumed for him and his friends a kind of substantial existence;
and constantly in talk, and occasionally in writing, he would keep
up the play of reporting their sayings and doings quite gravely, as
in the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>Stobo Manse, July 1882.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="scs">DEAR HENLEY</span>,... I am not worth an old damn. I
am also crushed by bad news of Symonds; his good lung
going; I cannot help reading it as a personal hint; God
help us all! Really, I am not very fit for work; but I
try, try, and nothing comes of it.</p>

<p>I believe we shall have to leave this place; it is low,
damp, and <i>mauchy</i>; the rain it raineth every day; and
the glass goes tol-de-rol-de-riddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>362</span></p>

<p>Yet it&rsquo;s a bonny bit; I wish I could live in it, but
doubt. I wish I was well away somewhere else. I feel
like flight some days; honour bright.</p>

<p>Pirbright Smith is well. Old Mr. Pegfurth Bannatyne
is here staying at a country inn. His whole baggage is
a pair of socks and a book in a fishing-basket; and he
borrows even a rod from the landlord. He walked here
over the hills from Sanquhar, &ldquo;singin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;like a
mavis.&rdquo; I naturally asked him about Hazlitt. &ldquo;He
wouldnae take his drink,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a queer, queer fellow.&rdquo;
But did not seem further communicative. He says he has
become &ldquo;releegious,&rdquo; but still swears like a trooper. I
asked him if he had no headquarters. &ldquo;No likely,&rdquo; said
he. He says he is writing his memoirs, which will be
interesting. He once met Borrow; they boxed; &ldquo;and
Geordie,&rdquo; says the old man chuckling, &ldquo;gave me the
damnedest hiding.&rdquo; Of Wordsworth he remarked, &ldquo;He
wasnae sound in the faith, sir, and a milk-blooded, blue-spectacled
bitch forbye. But his po&rsquo;mes are grand&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no denying that.&rdquo; I asked him what his book
was. &ldquo;I havenae mind,&rdquo; said he&mdash;that was his only
book! On turning it out, I found it was one of my own,
and on showing it to him, he remembered it at once. &ldquo;O
aye,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I mind now. It&rsquo;s pretty bad; ye&rsquo;ll have
to do better than that, chieldy,&rdquo; and chuckled, chuckled.
He is a strange old figure, to be sure. He cannot endure
Pirbright Smith&mdash;&ldquo;a mere æsthatic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fishin&rsquo; and releegion&mdash;these are my aysthatics,&rdquo; he
wound up.</p>

<p>I thought this would interest you, so scribbled it down.
I still hope to get more out of him about Hazlitt, though
he utterly pooh-poohed the idea of writing H.&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;Ma
life now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s been queer things in <i>it</i>.&rdquo; He
is seventy-nine! but may well last to a hundred!&mdash;Yours
ever,</p>
